Question,Strength of association between instrument and exposure F statistic < 10 in the same sample. (< 10 indicating a weak instrument),Reported test on association between confounders and IV. (testing the assumption that the instrument is associated with your outcome only via your exposure),"Included confounders in the IV analysis. Yes = may introduce bias, except for ethnicity",Presence of pleiotropy for IV tested,"Homogenous population or similar ancestry? If no, stratified by ethnicity or adjusted for population stratification (yes/no)","Homogenous population or similar ancestry? If no, stratified by ethnicity or adjusted for population stratification (yes/no)","Provide information on the similarity of the genetic variant-exposure associations between the exposure and outcome samples. Two-Sample MR: same allele frequency, same ancestry etc.","Provide information on extent of sample overlap between the exposure and
outcome data sources","Have they performed sensitivity analyses. Use sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the main results to violations of the assumptions. Report results from other sensitivity analyses (e.g., replication study with different dataset, analyses of subgroups, validation of instrument(s), simulations, etc.). Report any assessment of direction of causality (e.g., bidirectional MR). When relevant, report and compare with estimates from non-MR analyses. ","Is information on the methodology missing. E.g. the MR estimator, unit explanation, N for exposure/outcome, N SNPs (also if information presneted is not the same as original GWAS papers)",Is the  methodology reproducible? ,Are the statistical paramaters for the analysis gien - i.e. what to do about palindromes and proxy SNPs
High (3),F less than 10,Yes AND there is an obvious association ,Yes (lifestyle factors),No test/investigation performed or not discussed,"non-homogenous population (e.g. black and white together, etc.)","non-homogenous population (e.g. black and white together, etc.)",Different ancestry,Not reported/assumed overlap,Not reported / not performed,Majority of information missing or incorrect - key info such as MR estimator and/or N SNPs missing,No code provided and no software/packages referenced,No
Moderate (2),F missing,Not presented or presented and there is some degree of association (most two-sample MR here) ,Not discussed (one-sample/meta-analysis),Post-hoc sensitivitiy analysis (e.g. MR Egger),population described as homogenous (e.g. whites only) BUT not corrected for ancestry informative markers like principal components derived from GWAS,population described as homogenous (e.g. whites only) BUT not corrected for ancestry informative markers like principal components derived from GWAS,Not reported/Assumed same underlying ancestry,Not reported/assumed no overlap,Reported,Some information missing such as N for exposure/outcome,Software/packages referenced,Some
Low (1),F greater than 10 ,Presented and no obvious association ,No,Excluded pleiotropic SNPs prior to analysis / re-ran analysis after discovery (e.g post MR Egger) / sensitivity analysis consistent with main analysis,population described as homogenous (e.g. whites only) AND corrected for ancestry informative markers like principal components derived from GWAS,population described as homogenous (e.g. whites only) AND corrected for ancestry informative markers like principal components derived from GWAS,Tested and same ancestry,Reported/no overlap,Reported in the context of main analysis / can't do it (e.g. one SNP used),Majority of information presented and correct,Code is provided and all software/packages are referenced,Yes/NA because 1 SNP/directly genotyped
