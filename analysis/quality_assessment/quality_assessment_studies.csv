Since analyses were performed using summarized genetic association data in aggregate, it was not possible to restrict age at natural menopause analyses exclusively to participants who had undergone menopause.

these analyses would likely have biased results toward the null (i.e., providing a conservative effect estimate).

However, we note that MR Egger regression is valid under the assumption that the association between genetic variants and the exposure (here BMI) is independent of the direct effects the genetic variants have on the outcome (here VTE). This assumption is also known as the InSIDE assumption and would thus be violated if any pleiotropic effects act through a confounder of the BMI–VTE association. Further, we note that MR Egger regression is only sensitive to directional pleiotropy, thus it will not detect situations where several SNPs exhibit pleiotropy but in different directions, canceling out the “overall effect” of pleiotropy. In addition, compared to the 2-sample MR analysis that was primarily used here, MR Egger regression has less power to detect a true causal effect in the presence of balanced pleiotropy.","For the second assumption, the major potential confounder is population stratification.

In the mediation analyses, where we include both genetically predicted triacylglycerols and HbA1c, we are assuming that these factors are not causally related to each other. We tested for causal relationships between potential mediators prior to our main two-step MR analyses and these do not suggest any causal effects between triacylglycerols and HbAlc or other glycaemic traits.","Not discussed","Not discussed",NA,"BMI on LDL",-0.05,-0.19,0.09

Fourthly, it is recognized that there are sex-specific psychological and physiological factors affecting the obesity-depression relationship.
