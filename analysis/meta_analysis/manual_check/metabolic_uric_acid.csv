Second, the approach used here is not the classical Mendelian Randomization approach but a slight deviation from it (which has been considered in Hernan et al), since both the SUA and adiposity-related genetic variants used as instruments are not the direct gene products. Thus, there is always a risk that the proteins on the pathway work as confounders and drive the association. Third, since we included only middle-aged Caucasians, the findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Fourth, the approach of selecting the best genetic instrument in the CoLaus sample may be subject to over-fitting.","Some of the potential sources of residual confounding may arise due to pleiotropy and population stratification. Pleiotropy of genetic variants is difficult to address without examining all the biological pathways and this is often not possible because of the lack of understanding on the exact underlying mechanisms. However, we did not observe significant associations between any of the instruments and potential confounders suggesting that the associations are unlikely to be mediated through biological pathway involving the measured confounders.","It is reasonable to speculate that residual confounding from the association between the instruments and unmeasured confounders is minimal based on our findings of comparable crude and adjusted estimates (particularly in the direction of adiposity causing elevated SUA). We also did not find evidence of confounding by population stratification in our data.","Finally, an important issue is that the statistical power is, in general, not the same in both directions. In this regard, it is interesting to note that our confidence intervals of the instrumental variable analyses were in general wider when estimating a causal effect of adiposity on SUA than when estimating a causal effect of SUA on adiposity (recall that since all variables are standardized, the effects are expressed on a similar scale, which allows such a comparison).","They used different SNPs (but from the same gene regions) in each of their exposures - e.g., they used the rs1121980 variant in FTO for both weight and BMI but the rs 7193144 for fat mass and rs1861868 for waist circumference. They also used two FTO variants in each instrument plus a variant in TMEM18. I also don't remember reading whether they had tested whether these SNPs were independent",1356
