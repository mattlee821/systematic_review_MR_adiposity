The Barker hypothesis posits that intrauterine growth restriction resulting in lower birthweight is causal for these diseases, but causality is difficult to infer from observational studies. We address this important question with Mendelian randomization analysis to shed light on biological mechanisms behind these complex traits. In traditional observational analyses, self-reported birth weight was inversely associated with blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus and directly associated with body mass index and body fat percentage.","Two-sample summary-level","type 2 diabetes","log odds type 2 diabetes","metabolic","Type 2 diabetes (log-odds)","Morris 2012 T2D European both","18+","both","34840","114981","34840","114981",NA,"Case/control","European","birth weight","birth weight","Horikoshi 2016 Birth Weight Trans-ancestry both",NA,"both","143677","153781","From this study sample, we excluded 158 individuals who had withdrawn consent at the time of the study.

To minimize the risk of pleiotropy affecting our results, we performed analyses using 3 different IVs: IV1: Including up to 58 independent lead variants (excluding the insulin-like growth factor 2 [IGF2] locus because of imprinting; see Methods section in the Data Supplement) from the GWAS of birthweight performed by the EGG consortium8; IV2: Including up to 46 variants after exclusion of 12 variants associated with CAD, AF, IS, and T2D at GWAS significance; any confounders at GWAS significance; or with any of the confounders or CAD, AF, IS, and T2D at a P value lower than the P value for association with birthweight (Figure II and Table II in the Data Supplement). These associations were estimated in UKB. IV3: Excluded 1 to 9 heterogeneous variants (different for each outcome; Figure III in the Data Supplement). We performed a stepwise downward model selection in which SNPs were iteratively removed from the risk score until the heterogeneity test was no longer significant at the prespecified threshold (P<0.05) using the R package gtx. We decided a priori that IV2 would constitute our main model (balancing high statistical power and low risk of pleiotropy) but included IV1 to maximize power and IV3 to decrease risk of pleiotropy in sensitivity analyses.","p < 5Ã—10-8","Not discussed","Yes","Not discussed",NA,"17",NA,"60","Including up to 46 variants after exclusion of 12 variants associated with CAD, AF, IS, and T2D at GWAS significance; any confounders at GWAS significance; or with any of the confounders or CAD, AF, IS, and T2D at a P value lower than the P value for association with birthweight (Figure II and Table II in the Data Supplement).
