First, though F-statistics generated for most risk factors suggested that results were unlikely to suffer from weak instrument bias, statistical power for some analyses of less common ovarian cancer subtypes (low grade serous, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas) was likely modest, meaning that the possibility that some results may reflect “false negative” findings cannot be ruled out. Since analyses were performed using summarized genetic association data in aggregate, it was not possible to restrict age at natural menopause analyses exclusively to participants who had undergone menopause. However, given that most ovarian cancer cases occur after menopause and that age-matched controls were used, the inclusion of some pre- or perimenopausal women in
these analyses would likely have biased results toward the null (i.e., providing a conservative effect estimate). Additionally, models employed assumed no interaction (e.g., geneenvironment, gene-gene) or effect modification and linear relationships between risk factors and ovarian cancer. Lastly, the use of a MR framework precluded directly examining the causal effects of some ovarian cancer risk factors that do not have robust genetic variants available to serve as proxies (e.g., use of oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy).","not discussed","Not discussed","First, though F-statistics generated for most risk factors suggested that results were unlikely to suffer from weak instrument bias, statistical power for some analyses of less common ovarian cancer subtypes (low grade serous, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas) was likely modest, meaning that the possibility that some results may reflect “false negative” findings cannot be ruled out.",NA,2080
