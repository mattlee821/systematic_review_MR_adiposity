The present sample also lacks data on a complete repertoire of potential mediators, such as lipid traits and glucose levels; these data will be available in the full UK Biobank in the next few years.","There may be a degree of selection bias in the sense that less physically and cognitively impaired individuals responded to theUKBiobank invitation and attended the assessment. The UK Biobank cohort is representative of the UK population in terms of some characteristics, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation, but not necessarily all (eg,someparticipants are less likely tosmoke and drink alcohol regularly).","Because MR-Egger is inherently more conservative, potentially meaningful causal associations might not be identified (type II error). Furthermore, this approach may be inadequately powered to detect pleiotropy when it is present.","Note: it's unclear how many individuals were used as controls, as the authors only state the number of cases and not the number of controls or not how many individuals overlapped between the four binary outcomes (i.e., stroke, CHD, hypertension and T2D). One note is that they state that they used 97 variants from the study of 339224 individuals of EUROPEAN descent. So actually unclear as to whether they used the European adults one or the all ancestries results. Note that the authors also did an adjusted model for townsend deprivation score, smoking and alcohol.  The results didn't really change when adding these (the betas attenuated slightly with some and inflated in others but confidence intervals all overlapped).",1353

Finally, in all analyses, we only included participants with complete data on all variables used in the specific model (ie, complete data on BMI, outcome and all confounders in multivariable analyses and on genetic instruments, BMI and outcome in Mendelian randomization). This assumes that missing data are missing at random. The similarity in characteristics between those with complete data and those with any missing data suggested that this assumption is unlikely to be violated.","Although we aimed to make best use of all available data, our main analyses included the use of an aggregate GRS comprising all 97 SNPs associated with BMI, which may increase the possibility of horizontal pleiotropy.","Not discussed","Given the small range of some of the cardiovascular outcomes (for example, cIMT) in these young individuals and the potentially small effect size of BMI, power to detect such small effect sizes in this context may be limited.",NA,1784
