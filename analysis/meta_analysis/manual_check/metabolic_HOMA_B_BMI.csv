Although adult BMI is not strictly a confounder, 12 of the 15 SNPs for childhood BMI are also reported signals for adulthood. Further investigations on the timing of the exposure are warranted. Finally, we cannot directly assess whether population stratification and other potential confounders may be influencing our results; residual and unmeasured confounding might remain.","The MREgger regression showed that the estimated intercept term was centered at the origin with a CI including the null, suggesting that our results were not being influenced by pleiotropy","we cannot directly assess whether population stratification may influence our results","The large sample size allowed us to assess the consistency of associations across different methods and to gain sufficient power for reliable estimation of causal effects.",NA,929

This is possibly accounted for by the fact that the results from the 9-year cohort were not replicated in the combined 3-year cohort, even though we did not test the heteroge- neity between these cohorts with the comparable sample sizes and characteristics of subjects at baseline. Second, we did not conduct sex- specific instruments of WHR for type 2 diabetes because of the limited numbers of subjects. But we found that the WHR-GRS performed similarly in males and females.
