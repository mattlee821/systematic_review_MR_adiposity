However, we know that this approach reduces power, since power for Mendelian Randomization is a function of the variance explained of the SNPs in the GRSA, and for the complex traits in our study, the majority of the genetic signal is contained in SNPs that do not meet GWS. We recognize that while incorporating many additional true positives (increasing power), that many false-positives are included as well (decreasing the GRSA estimate). Because of this, we wanted to identify a P-value cutoff in which we limited the number of SNPs included, therefore limiting the number of false positive SNPs included, but which the set of SNPs closely reach maximal power. Therefore, for each trait, we plotted the variance of the trait explained vs. P-value threshold to determine the P-value cut-off for which the variance explained was maximized and included the fewest number of SNPs (Figure S4 and Table S9).  Due to the downward bias of the GRSA estimate, we use this secondary analysis to only identify potential associations by evaluating the significance of the GRSA estimate at maximal power (Pmax), and do not draw any conclusions from the magnitude of the GRSA estimate (GRSAmax).","Not discussed","Not discussed","Not discussed",NA,NA,"40","52","Not discussed","No",NA,"Inverse variance weighted","HEIDI-outlier","MR Egger","Simple median","Weighted median",NA,"Not reported","No","R","The associations of these SNPs with the risk factors and the SCA outcome are used to calculate an inverse-variance weighted multi-SNP GRSA as implemented in the R-package ‘gtx’.","Not discussed","No - they did an overall MR and then subsetted men and women and repeated","false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of FDR < 0.05.","Inverse normally transformed","SD","GRSA estimate","0.36499999999999999",NA,"95","0.19500000000000001","0.53500000000000003","2.51x10-5","FDR","3.88x10-5","Although we did not explicitly exclude SNPs associated withmultiple risk factors (genetic pleiotropy), we did utilize a goodness-of-fit approach to exclude putative ‘pleiotropic’ effects from all GRSAs.
