First, if the exposure is a composite trait that comprises multiple sub-phenotypes, we could not rule out the possibility that the effect of exposure on disease is driven by one of the sub-phenotypes. Second, the effect of a risk factor on disease can be non-linear. Fourth, our analyses ignored age-specific and sex-specific effects because of the lack of data from age- and sex-stratified analyses.","results were not driven by pleiotropy and reverse causality. In some cases, the relationship between a risk factor and a disease could be a mixture of multiple models. the intercepts from MR-Egger (a significant deviation of the intercept from 0 is evidence for the presence of pleiotropy) were very small relative to the slopes (Supplementary Fig. 24), and there was no inflation in the test-statistics (Supplementary Fig. 24b, c), suggesting that the degree of pleiotropy was negligible if there was any.","Not discussed","Third, although we have identified a large number of associations, we would expect that associations of small effect size would be missed in our study.",NA,2198
