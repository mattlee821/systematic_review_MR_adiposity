Thecausal associations may have been influenced byparental genotype-socioeconomic status associations. The educational, job status, and income data used in this study were self reported, which may result in measurement bias. However, Townsend deprivation index was derived by the UK Biobank and we observed consistent trends across the different socioeconomic status constructs, suggesting limited bias due to self report. Socioeconomic status is a very complex multidimensional
construct. We looked at a range of individual
components and observed similar trends for each, but
the selected variables may not cover the entirety of
social status. This study used a homogenous population,
so the results may not be generalisable to other
ethnic groups.","SNPs selected for height and BMI may have effects on socioeconomic status not mediated by their effects on height or BMI (pleiotropy), which were not measured but could potentially affect socioeconomic status. However, to minimise this possibility, we selected SNPs carefully and used the Egger method, which can detect and adjust for pleiotropy bias in many scenarios24 (hence the broader confidence intervals observed).","Finally, height, BMI, and socioeconomic status are subtly stratified across the United Kingdom, with people living and working in the north of the country having lower socioeconomic status, higher BMI, and shorter stature, on average, than those in the south. If genetic variants are also subtly different between north and south, this could have confounded our results. However, several factors mean that this population stratification should not have caused false positive results. Firstly, we would not have expected to have seen differences between men and women (because gene allele frequencies do not differ between the sexes). Secondly, we used both within UK genetic ancestry principal components and a second method that corrects for all levels of relatedness, and our results did not change.","power was limited for some of the causal associations for BMI",NA,1732
