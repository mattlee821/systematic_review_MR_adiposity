They say that outcomes in validation sets aren't included","0.34100000000000003","The validity of our results depends on whether the instrumental variable assumptions hold, such that the genetic variants only affect the outcomes through BMI (the exposure). We ensured our BMI allele score was a strong instrument for BMI, and was not associated with common confounding variables such as sex and potential socio-economic confounders such as household social class. In contrast, BMI at age 8 was associated with confounders consistent with the social patterning reported previously45-47. The allele score was composed of 32 BMI-associated genetic variants. While a larger number of SNPs increases the power to detect associations, this also means that the third instrumental variable assumption may be more likely to be invalid for at least one genetic variant included in the allele score. A number of mechanisms could invalidate the third instrumental variable assumption: that the genetic variants only affect the outcomes through BMI at age 8. These include genetic induced confounding through horizontal  leiotropy (where a locus affects several outcomes directly9), population stratification and linkage disequilibrium, each of which could add a causal path from the IV to an outcome which was not mediated via BMI.","The effect estimates when using two independent instruments (FTO and the remaining 31 variants) were consistent providing evidence against pleiotropy because it is unlikely that two independent instruments suffer the same pleiotropic effects. Furthermore, the IV estimates using the 52-SNP allele score were consistent with the IV estimates of our 32-SNP score. However, we found evidence of heterogeneity when testing the 32 SNPs individually using Hansen tests, for 5 of the 21 ‘top’ results. This may indicate either the core or point identifying IV assumptions are invalid.","In the methods the authors say that they performed EIGENSTRAT analysis which ""revealed no additional obvious population stratification"" and that they restricted analysis to individuals of white European ethnic origin to reduce the potential for population stratification","Any biases introduced by violations of these assumptions may be amplified due to the low power of the individual SNPs. This is because these weak instruments account for only a small proportion of the variance of BMI, such that their effect through BMI is small compared with the strength of the association through one of these alternative pathways13. Further tests to investigate heterogeneity could be performed in follow up analyses.","The authors performed an MR-PheWAS so technically their first analysis was the direct G-O association. They do not present all of these results, only those that reach their specific p-value thresholds corrected for multiple testing. They then run an IV analysis and again only present those that reach a certain threshold. I've presented these results.",1453

The mediators that we took forward into MR-based mediation analyses (triacylglycerols, HbA1c and type 2 diabetes) had consistent causal effects across these different methods for both steps (i.e. the effect ofBMI on them and of them on CHD). In the mediation analyses, where we include both genetically predicted triacylglycerols and HbA1c, we are assuming that these factors are not causally related to each other. We tested for causal relationships between potential mediators prior to our main two-step MR analyses and these do not suggest any causal effects between triacylglycerols and HbAlc or other glycaemic traits.","Not discussed","Not discussed",NA,2074
