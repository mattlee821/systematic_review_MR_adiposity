Trait variance explained was defined as the increase in adjusted R2 by inclusion of the GRS in the linear regression model. F-statistics were computed using the formula F=((n-k-1)/k)(R^2/〖1-R〗^2 ), where n is the number of observations, k=1 for number of instruments, and R2 the unadjusted R2","R","R package MendelianRandomization","Not discussed","Replicated in white british only subset. Consitent with main analysis","For the obesity trait-disease analyses, the P-value threshold was set at <0.001 (= 0.05/51) for the total of 51 obesity trait-disease combinations investigated in the study.

in included studies, differential availability of summary-level sex-stratified GWAS data and
the potential for biases to operate differentially between women and men pose additional complexities in deciphering underlying causal effects. It is possible that our genetic instrument for WHRadjBMI might show features of colliderbias whereby SNPs included in the GRS associate with both higher WHR and lower BMI leading to potentially spurious findings. Sensitivity analysis supported main findings. Different SNPs and weightings for SNPs all supported main findings.","Performed extensive re-analysis using different SNP sets which were all consistent with main analysis","Results not generalizeable outside of Europeans. Recent studies have highlighted potential population stratification in both Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) and UKBB. Another study has indicated that GRS distributions can differ slightly between different European populations. We therefore conducted analyses both in all Europeans (self-report of any “white” category) in the main analyses and in a subset of British participants only (in the “White British ancestry subset” as classified by the UK Biobank. The results were highly similar to those performed in all Europeans.","Samll case samples in cancers may have lead to weak power. In women, the effects of WHR were directionally consistent with harm, but the estimates were imprecise, probably reflecting insufficient powerin the sex-stratified analysis.",NA,452
