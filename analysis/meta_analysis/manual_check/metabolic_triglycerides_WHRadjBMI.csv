In this study we perform MR analyses of BMI and WHR together with recently developed methods that are robust to horizontal pleiotropy under additional assumptions. We therefore employ MR-Egger regression to provide a test for unbalanced pleiotropy and a causal estimate of exposure on outcome in its presence10, 11. In addition we use the weighted median estimator which can give valid estimates even in the presence of horizontal pleiotropy provided at least 50 per cent of the information in the analysis comes from variants that are valid instruments, and has the advantage of retaining greater precision in the estimates compared to MR-Egger12.","Not discussed",NA,"Performed MVMR as sensitivity: We found some evidence for association of both adiposity instruments with smoking, but not with other major confounders (Supplemental Table 16).
