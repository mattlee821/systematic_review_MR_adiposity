In large samples such as the UK Biobank cohort, it is difficult to fully remove population structure without removing true effects.","Secondly, the follow-up analysis showed evidence of an association between the body mass index polygenic score and baseline confounders. If the body mass index SNPs affect these confounders independently (horizontal pleiotropy), then the assumptions of mendelian randomisation are violated, and bias would be introduced.","In large samples such as the UK Biobank cohort, it is difficult to fully remove population structure without removing true effects.63 Coincident structure could confound the association between body mass index and subjective wellbeing, generating spurious signal. Although we cannot completely remove the possible influence of structure in our follow-up analysis, we are reasonably confident that the effect of body mass index on satisfaction with health is not spurious because we do not see the same inflation for the negative control outcomes of domain satisfaction or happiness.","However, coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction are rare outcomes, and the SNPs for coronary artery disease risk used in our analysis all had small effect sizes,30 resulting in limited power to detect an effect on subjective wellbeing. However, the continuous phenotype of blood pressure still showed no causal effects on subjective wellbeing, further supporting residual confounding. Overall, the evidence suggests no causal effect of cardiovascular health on subjective wellbeing.",NA,2057
