Such a potential bias would probably be nondifferential, particularly for FTO genotype and therefore is unlikely to explain our results. A further limitation is that we were not able to demonstrate a statistically significant association between two other BMI-associated loci, MC4R (rs17782313) and TMEM18 (rs6548238), and risk of DVT alone or complicated by PE; however, these genotypes have been shown to have even less effect on BMI than the FTO genotype and therefore less statistical  power. It could also be argued that inclusion of only white subjects of Danish descent is a limitation of this study; however, we are not aware of any evidence to suggest that our findings should not be applicable to most races in most countries. The control function estimator, or adjusted twostage odds ratios method, gives a valid test of the null hypothesis, but interpretation and comparison of the magnitude of odds ratios are limited.","Not discussed","Not discussed","Not discussed","Sample size was a major limitation here and really unclear as to how many people had the exposure/outcome measured. Specifically, the total sample of Copenhagen City Heart Study and Copenhagen General Population study combined is 87574. Of these,  86267 had genetic information and 86112 of these had BMI available. In the first paragraph of the results, the authors say that 2158 individuals had the outcome (DVT); however, when you add up the numbers of individuals with DVT stratified by normal weight, overweight, moderate obesity and severe obesity, there are 1859 individuals with DVT. The third number is different than what is stated in the figure of results (they say 396 rather than 369, so it's unclear how many people actually have the disease). Lastly, in their MR results, they do not say how many people the results include and therefore I can't tell how many cases/controls there are in any analysis. They also only show results for FTO but in the supplement, they look at both FTO and MC4R and an allele score of both of them (which is mentioned throughout but isn't in the main tables/figures).",1289
