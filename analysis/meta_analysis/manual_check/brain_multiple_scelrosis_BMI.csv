Secondly, we note that both GIANT and the IMSGC used samples from the WTCCC cohort; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of sample overlap. This may have introduced bias into our results; however, given the sample size employed, this effect would likely be small since the WTCCC comprised ~2.5% of the overall GIANT consortium. Third, because of our use of summary-level statistics, we could not investigate nonlinear effects of BMI. Lastly, we cannot determine whether an established and more actionable intermediate, such as vitamin D, is primarily driving this causal relationship, nor can we conclude whether BMI influences MS progression.","First, while we undertook multiple sensitivity analyses to assess for pleiotropy, the possibility of residual pleiotropy is difficult to exclude. However, consistency across these approaches, and the fact that the MR-Egger intercept was centered at the origin, provides evidence that pleiotropy did not greatly influence the results.","We can also not directly assess whether population stratification or compensatory mechanisms (otherwise known as canalization) may be influencing our results; however, these would likely bias our estimates towards the null.","They don't mention power in the discussion but do say ""This two-sample approach has equivalent statistical power to one-sample approaches [31] and is favorable in this setting since large GWAS consortia exist for both BMI and MS and are thus better powered than an MR study in a single cohort with a smaller sample size.""","The authors also did some sensitivity analyses that were more quality control (so didn't add them into the sensitivity analyses bit here) - they checked whether the inclusion of proxy SNPs introduced random error so excluded those and re-ran analyses, then re-ran analyses with all proxies with an allele frequency of between 0.4-0.6. Then the re-ran the analysis excluding SNPs that were in LD with any loci associated at genome-wide significance with height (to remove any concerns that results were confounded by height).",1471
