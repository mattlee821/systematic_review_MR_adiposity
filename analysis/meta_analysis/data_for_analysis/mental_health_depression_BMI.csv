However, we would expect measurement error to cause the estimates for fat and non-fat to become more similar, so the fact that we observed a significant difference indicates that the UK Biobank measurements were sufficiently accurate for our purpose. Thirdly, while we found only suggestive evidence that location of fat affects risk of depression, we recognize that the high correlations between measurements taken in the trunk, arms and legs would have reduced our power to detect significant differences. Fourthly, it is recognized that there are sex-specific psychological and physiological factors affecting the obesity-depression relationship.
