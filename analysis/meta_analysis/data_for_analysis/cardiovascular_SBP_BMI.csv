Finally, in all analyses, we only included participants with complete data on all variables used in the specific model (ie, complete data on BMI, outcome and all confounders in multivariable analyses and on genetic instruments, BMI and outcome in Mendelian randomization). This assumes that missing data are missing at random. The similarity in characteristics between those with complete data and those with any missing data suggested that this assumption is unlikely to be violated.","Although we aimed to make best use of all available data, our main analyses included the use of an aggregate GRS comprising all 97 SNPs associated with BMI, which may increase the possibility of horizontal pleiotropy.","Not discussed","Given the small range of some of the cardiovascular outcomes (for example, cIMT) in these young individuals and the potentially small effect size of BMI, power to detect such small effect sizes in this context may be limited.",NA,1777
