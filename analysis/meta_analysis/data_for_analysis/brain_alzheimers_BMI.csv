and controls are required to reliably preclude any causal relation. A limitation
could be the observation that genetically low BMI is associated with low risk of hypertension. This is expected, as a causal relationship exists between high BMI and hypertension (36). However, because genetically low BMI is associated with low risk of hypertension, and because low risk of hypertension is associated with low risk of Alzheimer’s disease, these associations cannot explain the present observational relation between low BMI and high risk of Alzheimer’s disease.","Not discussed","They mention that their findings are based in a large homogenous population such that they can control for a number of important confounders and they included a positive control","Not discussed","This is the weighted allele score group and the resul using the simple unweighted score is similar",1481
