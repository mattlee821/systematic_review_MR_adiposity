This is possibly accounted for by the fact that the results from the 9-year cohort were not replicated in the combined 3-year cohort, even though we did not test the heteroge- neity between these cohorts with the comparable sample sizes and characteristics of subjects at baseline. Second, we did not conduct sex- specific instruments of WHR for type 2 diabetes because of the limited numbers of subjects. But we found that the WHR-GRS performed similarly in males and females. Thus, future research that explores sex-specific instruments in larger data sets may prove more conclu- sive.","Not discussed","owing to the the differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns, the generalizability of our GRS in other ethnic groups merits further investigation.","With the current sample size, the statistical power was 81% to detect the effect size of 0.147 kg/m2 for BMI with a minor allele frequency of 0.49 (as of rs6265 in BDNF) and was 61% to detect the effect size of 0.004 for WHR with a minor allele frequency of 0.41 (as of rs984222 in TBX15) given a two-sided type I error rate of 0.05","They reference their previous paper (161) for the SNPs, but the numbers dont add up and they also didnt perform a GWAS in the previous paper.
