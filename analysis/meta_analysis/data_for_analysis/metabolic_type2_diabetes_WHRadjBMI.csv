Independent SNPs were selected by taking all the SNPs specified as “index” SNPs in the men, women or combined-sexes analyses and then keeping the SNP with the lowest combined-sexes P-value within each 1 Mb sliding window for BMI, WHR, and WHRadjBMI separately.

For all GRSs, any SNPs found to be non-biallelic in the UK Biobank were excluded (n=6, rs7798002, rs73646205, rs10828247, rs10892873, rs699370, rs805768), as this would violate the additive assumption. Four SNPs were also excluded as they failed post-imputation quality control (rs11500477, rs144926207, rs547943994, rs9638713). To further ascertain that there was no LD between SNPs in a GRS, we computed the r2 between all pairs of SNPs included in an instrument–for pairs of correlated (r2>0.05) SNPs included in the same instrument, the SNP in each pair with the highest P-value was excluded (rs1025395, rs9302652, rs8189480).","Not discussed",NA,"Wald ratio","MR Egger","Weighted median",NA,NA,NA,"Consistent with main analysis: A few of the GRSs used in the main analysis showed evidence of directional pleiotropy in the MR-Egger intercept test. The MR-Egger point estimates for all these associations were of lower magnitude than the point estimates from the main MR analyses. Despite this, for all the disease outcome MR analyses where one sex had significantly higher estimates than the other the point estimates using the IVW, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods were all higher in the same sex as in the main analysis. This indicates that the sex differences we see are robust using different MR methods to compute causal estimates","Lowest F stat of any GRS was 4,921. We assessed the strengths of associations between the GRSs and their respective obesity trait by computing trait variance explained and the F-statistics. First, we standardized the obesity traits by rank inverse normal transformation of the residuals after regression of the obesity trait on baseline age, age2, assessment centre, and if applicable sex, after any sample quality exclusions. This was done separately for men and women in the sex-specific analyses, but jointly in the combined analyses. For WHRadjBMI, we also adjusted for BMI. We thereafter performed linear regression, adjusting for array type and 10 principal components. Trait variance explained was defined as the increase in adjusted R2 by inclusion of the GRS in the linear regression model. F-statistics were computed using the formula F=((n-k-1)/k)(R^2/〖1-R〗^2 ), where n is the number of observations, k=1 for number of instruments, and R2 the unadjusted R2","R","R package MendelianRandomization","Not discussed","Replicated in white british only subset.

in included studies, differential availability of summary-level sex-stratified GWAS data and
the potential for biases to operate differentially between women and men pose additional complexities in deciphering underlying causal effects. It is possible that our genetic instrument for WHRadjBMI might show features of colliderbias whereby SNPs included in the GRS associate with both higher WHR and lower BMI leading to potentially spurious findings. Sensitivity analysis supported main findings. Different SNPs and weightings for SNPs all supported main findings.","Performed extensive re-analysis using different SNP sets which were all consistent with main analysis","Results not generalizeable outside of Europeans. Recent studies have highlighted potential population stratification in both Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) and UKBB. Another study has indicated that GRS distributions can differ slightly between different European populations. We therefore conducted analyses both in all Europeans (self-report of any “white” category) in the main analyses and in a subset of British participants only (in the “White British ancestry subset” as classified by the UK Biobank. The results were highly similar to those performed in all Europeans.","Samll case samples in cancers may have lead to weak power.
