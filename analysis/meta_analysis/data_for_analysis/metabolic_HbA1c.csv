However, to explore the potential effects of this pleiotropy, we used different MR methods (IVW, medianbased estimators and MR-Egger) that have different assumptions and we assessed the consistency across each of these estimators. The mediators that we took forward into MR-based mediation analyses (triacylglycerols, HbA1c and type 2 diabetes) had consistent causal effects across these different methods for both steps (i.e. the effect ofBMI on them and of them on CHD). In the mediation analyses, where we include both genetically predicted triacylglycerols and HbA1c, we are assuming that these factors are not causally related to each other. We tested for causal relationships between potential mediators prior to our main two-step MR analyses and these do not suggest any causal effects between triacylglycerols and HbAlc or other glycaemic traits.","Not discussed","Not discussed",NA,2070
