Four SNPs were also excluded as they failed post-imputation quality control (rs11500477, rs144926207, rs547943994, rs9638713). To further ascertain that there was no LD between SNPs in a GRS, we computed the r2 between all pairs of SNPs included in an instrument–for pairs of correlated (r2>0.05) SNPs included in the same instrument, the SNP in each pair with the highest P-value was excluded (rs1025395, rs9302652, rs8189480).","Not discussed",NA,"Wald ratio","MR Egger","Weighted median",NA,NA,NA,"Consistent with main analysis: A few of the GRSs used in the main analysis showed evidence of directional pleiotropy in the MR-Egger intercept test.

Despite this, for all the disease outcome MR analyses where one sex had significantly higher estimates than the other the point estimates using the IVW, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods were all higher in the same sex as in the main analysis.

We assessed the strengths of associations between the GRSs and their respective obesity trait by computing trait variance explained and the F-statistics. First, we standardized the obesity traits by rank inverse normal transformation of the residuals after regression of the obesity trait on baseline age, age2, assessment centre, and if applicable sex, after any sample quality exclusions. This was done separately for men and women in the sex-specific analyses, but jointly in the combined analyses. For WHRadjBMI, we also adjusted for BMI. We thereafter performed linear regression, adjusting for array type and 10 principal components. Trait variance explained was defined as the increase in adjusted R2 by inclusion of the GRS in the linear regression model.

the potential for biases to operate differentially between women and men pose additional complexities in deciphering underlying causal effects. It is possible that our genetic instrument for WHRadjBMI might show features of colliderbias whereby SNPs included in the GRS associate with both higher WHR and lower BMI leading to potentially spurious findings. Sensitivity analysis supported main findings. Different SNPs and weightings for SNPs all supported main findings.","Performed extensive re-analysis using different SNP sets which were all consistent with main analysis","Results not generalizeable outside of Europeans. Recent studies have highlighted potential population stratification in both Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) and UKBB.
