AB  - Humans are social animals that experience intense suffering when they perceive a lack of social connection. Modern societies are experiencing an epidemic of loneliness. While the experience of loneliness is universally human, some people report experiencing greater loneliness than others. Loneliness is more strongly associated with mortality than obesity, emphasizing the need to understand the nature of the relationship between loneliness and health. While it is intuitive that circumstantial factors such as marital status and age influence loneliness, there is also compelling evidence of a genetic predisposition towards loneliness. To better understand the genetic architecture of loneliness and its relationship with associated outcomes, we conducted a genome-wide association (GWAS) meta-analysis of loneliness (N=475,661), report 12 associated loci (two novel) and significant genetic correlations with 34 other complex traits. The polygenic basis for loneliness was significantly enriched for evolutionary constrained genes and genes expressed in specific brain tissues: (frontal) cortex, cerebellum, anterior cingulate cortex, and substantia nigra. We built polygenic scores based on this GWAS meta-analysis to explore the genetic association between loneliness and health outcomes in an independent sample of 18,498 individuals for whom electronic health records were available. A genetic predisposition towards loneliness predicted cardiovascular, psychiatric, and metabolic disorders, and triglycerides and high-density lipoproteins. Mendelian randomization analyses showed evidence of a causal, increasing, effect of body fat on loneliness, and a similar weaker causal effect of BMI. Our results provide a framework for ongoing studies of the genetic basis of loneliness and its role in mental and physical health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration and high BMI have been associated with increased risk of diabetes. We tested the hypotheses that genetic variants associated with low concentrations of 25(OH)D are associated with diabetes, and that the effect on diabetes of genetic variants associated with high BMI is partly mediated through reduced plasma 25(OH)D concentration., METHODS: In this mendelian randomisation study, we genotyped 96 423 white Danes aged 20-100 years from three studies. 5037 of these participants had type 2 diabetes. All individuals were surveyed for diabetes from 1977 to 2011. 31 040 participants had their plasma 25(OH)D concentration measured and 90 169 had their BMI measured. We assessed the effects of genetic variation in DHCR7 (related to endogenous production) and CYP2R1 (related to liver conversion) on plasma 25(OH)D concentration, and the effects of variation in FTO, MCR4, and TMEM18 on BMI. We then assessed the effect of genetic variation in these genes on risk of type 2 diabetes, and the association of measured plasma 25(OH)D concentration and BMI with risk of type 2 diabetes. We did a mediation analysis to assess how much of the effect of BMI genotype on risk of diabetes was mediated through plasma 25(OH)D concentration., FINDINGS: The odds ratios for type 2 diabetes for participants who had a 20 nmol/L reduction in plasma 25(OH)D concentration as determined by genetics were 1.51 (95% CI 0.98-2.33) for DHCR7 and 1.02 (0.75-1.37) for CYP2R1. The DHCR7 allele score was significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (p for trend=0.04), whereas the allele score for CYP2R1 was not. For participants who had a measured 20 nmol/L reduction in plasma 25(OH)D concentration, the adjusted odds ratio for type 2 diabetes was 1.16 (1.08-1.25). For participants who had a 10 kg/m(2) increase in BMI as determined by genetics, the odds ratio for type 2 diabetes was 19.4 (6.4-59.1); this was associated with an 11.1 nmol/L (2.6-19.6) lower plasma 25(OH)D concentration. For a 10 kg/m(2) increase in measured BMI, the adjusted odds ratio for type 2 diabetes was 4.33 (3.70-5.07); this was associated with a 9.1 nmol/L (8.4-9.7) lower plasma 25(OH)D concentration. Mediation analysis showed that 3% (1-5) of the effect of BMI on risk of type 2 diabetes was mediated through lowered plasma 25(OH)D concentrations., INTERPRETATION: Genetic variants associated with low plasma 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with type 2 diabetes and low plasma 25(OH)D concentrations might be a modest mediator between obesity and increased risk of diabetes. Genetic variants associated with endogenous production of 25(OH)D might partially explain this increased risk; however, as findings for DHCR7 were not statistically significant, our results require independent confirmation., FUNDING: Danish Heart Foundation, Copenhagen University Hospital.

AB  - The Barker hypothesis states that low birth weight (BW) is associated with higher risk of adult onset diseases, including mental disorders like schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The main criticism of this hypothesis is that evidence for it comes from observational studies. Specifically, observational evidence does not suffice for inferring causality, because the associations might reflect the effects of confounders. Mendelian randomization (MR) - a novel method that tests causality on the basis of genetic data - creates the unprecedented opportunity to probe the causality in the association between BW and mental disorders in observation studies. We used MR and summary statistics from recent large genome-wide association studies to test whether the association between BW and MDD, schizophrenia and ADHD is causal. We employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method in conjunction with several other approaches that are robust to possible assumption violations. MR-Egger was used to rule out horizontal pleiotropy. IVW showed that the association between BW and MDD, schizophrenia and ADHD is not causal (all p > .05). The results of all the other MR methods were similar and highly consistent. MR-Egger provided no evidence for pleiotropic effects biasing the estimates of the effects of BW on MDD (intercept = -0.004, SE = 0.005, p = .372), schizophrenia (intercept = 0.003, SE = 0.01, p = .769), or ADHD (intercept = 0.009, SE = 0.01, p = .357). Based on the current evidence, we refute the Barker hypothesis concerning the fetal origins of adult mental disorders. The discrepancy between our results and the results from observational studies may be explained by the effects of confounders in the observational studies, or by the existence of a small causal effect not detected in our study due to weak instruments. Our power analyses suggested that the upper bound for a potential causal effect of BW on mental disorders would likely not exceed an odds ratio of 1.2.

AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 10% of adult mortality in Western populations. While several risk factors are observationally associated with SCA, the genetic architecture of SCA in the general population remains unknown. Furthermore, understanding which risk factors are causal may help target prevention strategies. Methods: We carried out a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) for SCA (n=3,939 cases, 25,989 non-cases) to examine common variation genome-wide and in candidate arrhythmia genes. We also exploited Mendelian randomization methods using cross-trait multi-variant genetic risk score associations (GRSA) to assess causal relationships of 18 risk factors with SCA. Results: No variants were associated with SCA at genome-wide significance, nor were common variants in candidate arrhythmia genes associated with SCA at nominal significance. Using cross-trait GRSA, we established genetic correlation between SCA and (1) coronary artery disease (CAD) and traditional CAD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes), (2) height and BMI, and (3) electrical instability traits (QT and atrial fibrillation), suggesting etiologic roles for these traits in SCA risk. Conclusions: Our findings show that a comprehensive approach to the genetic architecture of SCA can shed light on the determinants of a complex life-threatening condition with multiple influencing factors in the general population. The results of this genetic analysis, both positive and negative findings, have implications for evaluating the genetic architecture of patients with a family history of SCA, and for efforts to prevent SCA in high-risk populations and the general community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The insulin secretion hypothesis postulates that a high glycemic load diet causes weight gain via the anabolic effects of insulin, which result in increased hunger and lower energy expenditure. Dietary intervention studies of low-glycemic load diets in the treatment of obesity have had mixed success. One proposed explanation is that individual variability in carbohydrate-stimulated insulin secretion modifies the effect of dietary composition on weight gain. Animal models, cohort studies, and subgroup analyses of intervention studies suggest greater weight loss on low-glycemic load diets among high- but not low-insulin secretors. We hypothesize that insulin secretion modifies the effect of dietary composition on body weight. METHOD: We tested this hypothesis using a genetic approach. We estimated the causal effect of insulin-30 (insulin level 30 min. after 75-g glucose load), a proxy measure for insulin secretion on body mass index (BMI), using a genetic risk score-based Mendelian randomization analysis and summary statistics from large genome-wide association studies. In principle, Mendelian randomization is a genetic analog to a randomized trial that leverages the random allocation of phenotype-modifying alleles at meiosis to estimate causal effects, even in the presence of unmeasured confounding. We also used linear regression to estimate whether high insulin-30 risk (highest vs other genetic risk score tertiles) modified the effect of a dietary carbohydrate change (percentage of calories per day, a marker of glycemic load) on the between-visit rate of weight gain. We used a subset of the Framingham Offspring Study with genetic data and serial phenotypic data (n ~ 1000, average follow-up t=4 yr). Analyses were adjusted for baseline weight, age, sex, smoking status and total caloric intake per day. RESULTS: The Mendelian randomization analysis revealed an increase in genetically determined BMI of 0.12 k g /m2 for every 1 mU/L increase in genetically determined insulin-30 (P=1.3 x 10-11 ) and insulin-30 adjusted for BMI ( 0.11 kg/m2 P=3.3 x 10-9) . We found no effect of genetically determined BMI on insulin-30 (P=0.80). In the Framingham data, high insulin-30 risk modified the effect of increased carbohydrate intake on rate of weight gain (P= 0.009). A 10% increase in carbohydrate intake (e.g. 45% to 55% of daily calories) was associated with 0.11 kg/yr weight gain among highest insulin-30 risk individuals, while a comparable dietary change was associated with 0.19 kg/yr weight loss among the lower insulin-30 risk individuals. Replication of these findings in other cohorts, as well as the testing of interactions with other phenotypes is ongoing. CONCLUSION: Together, these findings lend genetic support to the hypothesis that insulin secretion modifies the effect of dietary composition on body weight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A fundamental precept of the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity is that insulin secretion drives weight gain. However, fasting hyperinsulinemia can also be driven by obesity-induced insulin resistance. We used genetic variation to isolate and estimate the potentially causal effect of insulin secretion on body weight., METHODS: Genetic instruments of variation of insulin secretion [assessed as insulin concentration 30 min after oral glucose (insulin-30)] were used to estimate the causal relationship between increased insulin secretion and body mass index (BMI), using bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis of genome-wide association studies. Data sources included summary results from the largest published metaanalyses of predominantly European ancestry for insulin secretion (n = 26037) and BMI (n = 322154), as well as individual-level data from the UK Biobank (n = 138541). Data from the Cardiology and Metabolic Patient Cohort study at Massachusetts General Hospital (n = 1675) were used to validate genetic associations with insulin secretion and to test the observational association of insulin secretion and BMI., RESULTS: Higher genetically determined insulin-30 was strongly associated with higher BMI (beta = 0.098, P = 2.2 x 10-21), consistent with a causal role in obesity. Similar positive associations were noted in sensitivity analyses using other genetic variants as instrumental variables. By contrast, higher genetically determined BMI was not associated with insulin-30., CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analyses provide evidence for a causal relationship of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion on body weight, consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity.

AB  - Low birth weight is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the association could be confounded by many factors. We used Mendelian randomization to clarify the role of birth weight in ischemic heart disease (IHD) and lipids. We used all 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) independently contributing to birth weight at genome wide significance (p < 5 x 10-8) in separate sample instrumental variable analysis to estimate the effect of birth weight on IHD using the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes based GWAS case (n = 60,801)-control (n = 123,504) study and on lipids using GLGC (n = 188,577). Higher genetically predicted birth weight was associated with lower risk of IHD (odds ratio (OR) 0.96 per 100 grams, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 0.99), but the association was not robust to sensitivity analyses excluding SNPs related to height or use of weighted median methods. Genetically predicted birth weight was not associated with low density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides, but was associated with lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.014 standard deviation, 95% CI -0.027 to -0.0005) and the association was more robust to the sensitivity analyses. Our study does not show strong evidence for an effect of birth weight on IHD and lipids.

AB  - Hemoglobin (Hb) is the main carrier of oxygen. In general, high-end Hb levels within the normal range are considered beneficial for health1. However, activation of the hypoxia response has been shown to protect mice against metabolic dysfunction2-4. We used Hb levels as an indicator for oxygenation status and studied its association with >170 anthropometric and metabolic parameters in two Finnish birth cohorts both in cross-sectional and longitudinal design (max n = 7,175). Here we show a positive linear association between Hb levels and body mass index (BMI). Subjects with the lower Hb levels had better glucose tolerance, lower cholesterol and blood pressure levels, less adverse metabolite profiles and lower inflammatory load. Notably, these associations were not only mediated by the lower BMI, and the effect size of many of them increased with age. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses indicated shared genetic determinants between Hb levels and BMI, insulin, triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses could not demonstrate causal relationships between Hb and metabolic parameters. However, manipulation of Hb levels by venesection in mice showed evidence for causal associations with body weight and metabolic parameters. Our findings suggest that lower-end normal Hb levels may be favorable for systemic metabolism involving mild chronic activation of the hypoxia response. Therefore modulation of Hb levels could be a novel strategy towards maintenance of metabolic health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether body mass index (BMI) is causally associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)., METHOD: A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger regression methods was performed. We used the publicly available summary statistics datasets of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analyses for BMI in individuals of European descent (n = 322,154) (GIANT consortium) as the exposure and a GWAS for non-cancer illness code self-reported: RA from the individuals included in the UK Biobank (total n = 337,159; case = 7,480, control = 329,679) as the outcome., RESULTS: We selected 68 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at genome-wide significance from GWASs on BMI as the instrumental variables (IVs). The IVW method showed evidence to support a causal association between BMI and RA (beta = 0.003, SE = 0.001, p = 0.033). MR-Egger regression revealed that directional pleiotropy was unlikely to be biasing the result (intercept = -3.54E-05; p = 0.736), but it showed no causal association between BMI and RA (beta = 0.004, SE = 0.004, p = 0.302). However, the weighted median approach yielded evidence of a causal association between BMI and RA (beta = 0.006, SE = 0.002, p = 0.004). Cochran's Q test and the funnel plot indicated no evidence of heterogeneity and asymmetry, indicating no directional pleiotropy., CONCLUSION: The results of MR analysis support that BMI may be causally associated with an increased risk of RA.

AB  - The "some invalid, some valid instrumental variable estimator" (sisVIVE) is a lasso-based method for instrumental variables (IVs) regression of outcome on an exposure. In principle, sisVIVE is robust to some of the IVs in the analysis being invalid, in the sense of being related to the outcome variable through pathways not mediated by the exposure. In this paper, we consider the application of sisVIVE to a Mendelian randomization study in which multiple genetic variants are used as IVs to estimate the causal effect of body mass index on personal income in the presence of unobserved confounding. In addition to analyzing data from the large-scale longitudinal household survey Understanding Society, we conduct a simulation study to (a) assess the performance of sisVIVE in relation to that of competing robust methods like "MR-Egger" and "MR-Median" and (b) identify scenarios under which its absolute performance is poor. We find that sisVIVE outperforms alternative robust methods, in terms of mean-square error, across a wide range of scenarios, but that its performance is poor in absolute terms when the presence of indirect pleiotropy leads to failure of the "InSIDE" condition, which is not explicitly required for identification. We argue that this is because the consistency criterion for sisVIVE does not identify the true causal effect when InSIDE fails. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Recent studies indicate childhood and adolescent obesity double the risk of MS, but this association may reflect unmeasured confounders rather than causal effects of obesity. We utilized separate-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on MS susceptibility. For non-Hispanic Caucasian members of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California (1,104 MS cases and 10,536 controls) and a replication dataset from Sweden (5,133 MS cases and 4,718 controls), a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed using 97 variants previously established to predict BMI. Models were adjusted for birth year, sex, education, smoking, ancestry, and genetic predictors of MS including HLA-DRB1*15:01 and 110 non-HLA variants. We also examined this relationship in non-Hispanic white pediatric MS cases and controls from over 15 sites across the U.S. (total sample size: 394 MS cases, 10,875 controls). Adjusted MR estimates suggested higher genetically induced BMI predicted greater MS susceptibility in adult KPNC and Swedish datasets (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04, 1.22 and OR=1.09, 95% CI 1.03, 1.15, respectively). A significant causal association between BMI GRS and pediatric MS was also demonstrated (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.06, 1.36; p=0.004) after adjusting for sex, ancestry, HLADRB1* 15:01, and 110 non-HLA MS risk variants. Although the mechanism remains unclear, these findings support a causal effect of increased BMI on MS and suggest a role for inflammatory pathways.

AB  - A total of 1,263 adults from Newfoundland and Labrador were studied in the research. Body mass index (BMI) and percent trunk fat (PTF) were analyzed as biomarkers for obesity. The Mendelian randomization (MR) approach with two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the fat-mass and obesity (FTO) gene as instruments was employed to assess the causal effect. In both genders, increasing physical activity significantly reduced BMI and PTF when adjusted for age and the FTO gene. The effect of physical activity was stronger on PTF than BMI. Direct observational analyses showed significant increase in BMI/PTF when physical activity decreased. A similar association in MR analyses was not significant. The association between physical activity and BMI/PTF could be due to reversed causality or common confounding factors. Our study provides insights into the causal contributions of obesity to physical activity in adults. Health intervention strategies to increase physical activity among adults should include some other plans such as improving diet for reducing obesity.

AB  - Introduction: Low levels of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol due to statin treatment has been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Hypothesis: We tested the hypothesis that low LDL-cholesterol due to genetic variants in the HMGCR, PCSK9, NPC1L1, ABCG8, APOE genes, and variants combined are associated with high risk of type 2 diabetes in the general population. Methods: We examined associations of plasma LDL-cholesterol levels with observational risk of type 2 diabetes; genetic variants with plasma LDL-cholesterol levels; and genetic variants with risk of type 2 diabetes as an indication of causality using a Mendelian randomization design in 110,217 participants from the Copenhagen General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Results: In observational analyses, risk of type 2 diabetes was 702% (95% confidence interval: 620%-793%) higher in participants with an LDL-cholesterol <1.5mmol/L versus >=3.0mmol/L. HMGCR, PCSK9, NPC1L1, ABCG8, and APOE genotypes combined were associated with a 23% lower LDL-cholesterol level. In causal genetic analyses, a 1mmol/L lower LDL-cholesterol was associated with a 0.74kg higher weight, a 0.29kg/m2 higher body mass index, and a nonsignificant odds ratio for type 2 diabetes of 1.08 (95%CI: 0.87-1.35). In causal genetic analysis using obesity associated genetic variants FTO, MC4R, TMEM18, BDNF, and GNPDA2, a 0.29kg/m2 higher body mass index translated into a 3.7% (0.2%-7.2%) higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Using 110,217 individuals from the general population, we found that low LDL-cholesterol level was observationally associated with high risk of type 2 diabetes. Genetically low LDL-cholesterol was causally associated with high weight and body mass index, and through this effect possibly with high risk of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - High body mass index (BMI) has been associated with increased risk of some cancer. Whether these reflect causal associations is unknown. We examined this issue. Using a Mendelian randomisation approach, we studied 108,812 individuals from the general population. During a median of 4.7 years of follow-up (range 0-37), 8002 developed non-skin cancer, 3347 non-melanoma skin cancer, 1396 lung cancer, 637 other smoking related cancers, 1203 colon cancer, 159 kidney cancer, 1402 breast cancer, 1062 prostate cancer, and 2804 other cancers. Participants were genotyped for five genetic variants associated with BMI. Two Danish general population studies, the Copenhagen General Population and the Copenhagen City Heart Study. In observational analyses, overall risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was 35 % (95 % confidence interval 28-42 %) lower and risk of lung cancer 32 % (19-43 %) lower in individuals with a BMI >= 30 versus 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2). Corresponding risk of breast cancer was 20 % (0-44 %) higher in postmenopausal women. BMI was not associated with risk of colon, kidney, other smoking related cancers, prostate cancer, or other cancers. In genetic analyses, carrying 7-10 versus 0-4 BMI increasing alleles was associated with a 3 % higher BMI (P < 0.001), but not with risk of cancer. In instrumental variable analysis for a 10 kg/m(2) higher genetically determined BMI the odds ratio for any non-skin cancer was 1.16 (0.64-2.09), with a corresponding observational estimate of 0.94 (0.88-1.01). Using 108,812 individuals from the general population, we found that observationally high BMI was associated with lower risk of lung and skin cancer overall and with higher risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, but not with other types of cancer. BMI increasing alleles were not associated with risk of cancer, and results do not support causal associations. Power to test associations for some cancer sites was low.

AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on the labor market consequences of obesity by using a novel instrument: genetic risk score, which reflects the predisposition to higher body mass index (BMI) across many genetic loci. We estimate instrumental variable models of the effect of BMI on labor market outcomes using Finnish data that have many strengths, for example, BMI that is measured rather than self-reported, and data on earnings and social income transfers that are from administrative tax records and are thus free of the problems associated with nonresponse, reporting error or top coding. The empirical results are sensitive to whether we use a narrower or broader genetic risk score, and to model specification. For example, models using the narrower genetic risk score as an instrument imply that a one-unit increase in BMI is associated with 6.9% lower wages, 1.8% fewer years employed, and a 3 percentage point higher probability of receiving any social income transfers. However, when we use a newer, broader genetic risk score, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. Future research using genetic risk scores should examine the sensitivity of their results to the risk score used. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Health Economics Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Rationale: Obesity is associated with decreasing telomere length (TL). The cause of this association is unknown. Objectives: By measuring leukocyte TL, body mass index (BMI) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 45069 individuals, we tested the hypothesis that increased BMI causes TL shortening, and that low-grade inflammation contributes through elevated CRP. Using the three obesity-associated polymorphisms rs9939609, rs17782313, and rs6548238, and the CRP promoter polymorphism rs3091244 in instrumental variable analyses, we estimated the causal associations between BMI and TL and between CRP and TL. Findings: In multivariable adjusted observational analyses, TL decreased with 5 base pairs (bp) (95% confidence interval -7; -3) per unit increase in BMI, and further adjustment for CRP attenuated this association to -2 bp (-4; 0.1). In accordance, instrumental variable analysis showed a causal non-significant TL shortening of 6 bp (-37; 25) per unit increase in BMI. Furthermore, in observational analyses TL decreased with 10 bp (-17; -3) for a doubling in CRP, supported by the instrumental variable analyses showing a causal decrease of 66 bp (-124; -7). Conclusions: The association between increasing BMI and decreasing TL may be causal, and possibly mediated through elevated CRP: elevated CRP per se is a causal determinant of TL shortening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Salivary (AMY1) and pancreatic (AMY2) amylases hydrolyze starch. Copy number of AMY1A (encoding AMY1) was reported to be higher in populations with a high-starch diet and reduced in obese people. These results based on quantitative PCR have been challenged recently. We aimed to re-assess the relationship between amylase and adiposity using a systems biology approach., METHODS: We assessed the association between plasma enzymatic activity of AMY1 or AMY2, and several metabolic traits in almost 4000 French individuals from D.E.S.I.R. longitudinal study. The effect of the number of copies of AMY1A (encoding AMY1) or AMY2A (encoding AMY2) measured through droplet digital PCR was then analyzed on the same parameters in the same study. A Mendelian randomization analysis was also performed. We subsequently assessed the association between AMY1A copy number and obesity risk in two case-control studies (5000 samples in total). Finally, we assessed the association between body mass index (BMI)-related plasma metabolites and AMY1 or AMY2 activity., RESULTS: We evidenced strong associations between AMY1 or AMY2 activity and lower BMI. However, we found a modest contribution of AMY1A copy number to lower BMI. Mendelian randomization identified a causal negative effect of BMI on AMY1 and AMY2 activities. Yet, we also found a significant negative contribution of AMY1 activity at baseline to the change in BMI during the 9-year follow-up, and a significant contribution of AMY1A copy number to lower obesity risk in children, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between AMY1 activity and adiposity. Metabonomics identified a BMI-independent association between AMY1 activity and lactate, a product of complex carbohydrate fermentation., CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into the involvement of amylase in adiposity and starch metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for several cancers although appears to have an inverse association with cancers strongly related to tobacco. Studying obesity is difficult due to numerous biases and confounding., METHODS: To avoid these biases we used a Mendelian randomization approach incorporating an analysis of variants in the FTO gene that are strongly associated with BMI levels among 7000 subjects from a study of lung, kidney and upper-aerodigestive cancer., RESULTS: The FTO A allele which is linked with increased BMI was associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (allelic odds ratio (OR) = 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-1.00). It was also associated with a weak increased risk of kidney cancer, which was more apparent before the age of 50 (OR = 1.44, CI 1.09-1.90)., CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the potential for genetic variation to act as an unconfounded marker of environmentally modifiable factors, and offer the potential to obtain estimates of the causal effect of obesity. However, far larger sample sizes than studied here will be required to undertake this with precision.

AB  - Background: Body Mass Index (BMI) is negatively correlated with subjective well-being and positively correlated with depressive symptoms. Whether these associations reflect causal effects or confounding is unclear. Methods: We examined causal effects between BMI and subjective well-being/depressive symptoms with bi-directional, two-sample Mendelian randomization using summary-level data from large genome-wide association studies. Genetic variants robustly related to the exposure variable acted as instrumental variable (two thresholds were used; p<5e-08 and p<1e-05). These instruments were then associated with the outcome variable. Pleiotropy was corrected for by two sensitivity analyses. Results: Substantial evidence was found for a causal effect of BMI on mental health, such that a higher BMI decreased subjective well-being and increased depressive symptoms. No consistent evidence was found for causality in the other direction. Conclusions: This study provides support for a higher BMI causing poorer mental health. Further research should corroborate these findings and consider non-linear effects and sex differences.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the causal relationships between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and body mass index (BMI)?, SUMMARY ANSWER: Bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses suggest that increased BMI is causal for PCOS while the reverse is not the case., WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The contribution of obesity to the pathogenesis of PCOS is controversial. To date, published genetic studies addressing this question have generated conflicting results and have not utilized the full extent of known single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with body mass index (BMI)., STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and genetic association study was conducted in 750 individuals of European origin and with PCOS and 1567 BMI-matched controls., PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cases and controls were matched for BMI as well as for distribution of weight categories (normal weight, overweight, obese). Two-sample MR using inverse variance weighting (IVW) was conducted using a 92-SNP instrument variable for BMI with PCOS as the outcome, followed by two-sample MR with a 16-SNP instrument variable for PCOS with BMI as the outcome. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger and maximum likelihood methods. Secondary analyses assessed associations of genetic risk scores and individual SNPs with PCOS, BMI and quantitative androgen-related and glucose homeostasis-related traits., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Each standard deviation genetically higher BMI was associated with a 4.89 (95% CI 1.46-16.32) higher odds of PCOS. Conversely, genetic risk of PCOS did not influence BMI. Sensitivity analyses yielded directionally consistent results. The genetic risk score of 92 BMI SNPs was associated with the diagnosis of PCOS (OR 1.043, 95% CI 1.009-1.078, P = 0.012). Of the 92 BMI risk variants evaluated, none were associated individually with PCOS after considering multiple testing. The association of FTO SNP rs1421085 with BMI was stronger in women with PCOS (beta = 0.071, P = 0.0006) than in controls (beta = 0.046, P = 0.065)., LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The current sample size, while providing good power for MR and genetic risk score analyses, had limited power to demonstrate association of individual SNPs with PCOS. Cases and controls were not matched for age; however, this was mitigated by adjusting analyses for age. Dietary and lifestyle data, which could have been used to explore the greater association of the FTO SNP with BMI in women with PCOS, was not available., WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Increasing BMI appears to be causal for PCOS but having PCOS does not appear to affect BMI. This study used the most comprehensive set of SNPs for BMI currently available. Prior studies using fewer SNPs had yielded conflicting results and may have been confounded because cases and controls were not matched for weight categories. The current results highlight the potential utility of weight management in the prevention and treatment of PCOS., STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): National Institutes of Health Grants R01-HD29364 and K24-HD01346 (to R.A.), Grant R01-DK79888 (to M.O.G.), Grant U54-HD034449 (to R.S.L.), Grant U19-HL069757 (to R.M.K.).

AB  - Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common inflammatory skin diseases reported to be associated with obesity, but the direction(s) of causality remain unclear. Mendelian Randomisation (MR) can be used to test for a causal relationship between a heritable phenotype and a possible clinical outcome. Genetic variants are used as an instrument to investigate causality and this reduces confounding and reverse causality. Our aim was to investigate a possible causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and psoriasis or AD. 401,508 individuals from the UK and Norway were studied using 1-sample MR and a genetic instrument to define BMI created using 97 polymorphisms from the most recent genome-wide association study. 2-sample MR was performed using published BMI, psoriasis and AD association data for 731,021 individuals. The 1- and 2-sample MR estimates were meta-analysed. A causal effect in the reverse direction - of psoriasis or AD upon BMI - was also investigated. These MR analyses have shown that BMI increases risk of psoriasis by 9% per kg/ m2 (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.12) and AD by 2% per unit increase in BMI (OR 1.02, 1.00- 1.03). Conversely, there is little evidence for either psoriasis or AD influencing BMI. The finding that increased BMI has a causal effect upon both psoriasis and AD raises the possibility of a common mechanism by which obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of skin inflammation. Interventions aimed at controlling BMI may therefore help to reduce the burden of inflammatory skin disease but there is little evidence that treatment of psoriasis or AD will reduce BMI.

AB  - Objective: Psoriasis and eczema are common inflammatory skin diseases that have been reported to be associated with obesity. However, causality has not yet been established. We aimed to investigate the possible causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and psoriasis or eczema. Methods: Following a review of published epidemiological evidence of the association between obesity and either psoriasis or eczema, Mendelian Randomization (MR) was used to test for a causal relationship between BMI and these inflammatory skin conditions. We used a genetic instrument comprising 97 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI. One-sample MR was conducted using individual-level data (401,508 individuals) from the UK Biobank and the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), Norway. Two-sample MR was performed with summary-level data (731,021 individuals) from published BMI, psoriasis and eczema GWAS. The one-sample and two-sample MR estimates were meta-analysed using a fixed effect model. To explore the reverse causal direction, MR analysis with genetic instruments comprising variants from recent genome-wide analyses for psoriasis and eczema were used to test if inflammatory skin disease has a causal effect on BMI. Results: Published observational data show an association of greater BMI with both psoriasis and eczema case status. The observational associations were confirmed in UK Biobank and HUNT datasets. MR analyses provide evidence that higher BMI causally increases the odds of psoriasis (by 53% per 5 units higher BMI; OR= 1.09 (1.06 to 1.12) per 1 kg/m2; P =4.67x10-9) and eczema (by 8% per 5 units higher BMI; OR=1.02 (1.00 to 1.03) per 1 kg/m2; P =0.09). When investigating causality in the opposite direction, MR estimates provide little evidence for an effect of either psoriasis or eczema influencing BMI. Conclusion: Our study, using genetic variants as instrumental variables for BMI, shows that higher BMI leads to a higher risk of inflammatory skin disease. The causal relationship was stronger for psoriasis than eczema. Therapies and life-style interventions aimed at controlling BMI or targeting the mechanisms linking obesity with skin inflammation may offer an opportunity for the prevention or treatment of these common skin diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease that has been reported to be associated with obesity. We aimed to investigate a possible causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and psoriasis., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following a review of published epidemiological evidence of the association between obesity and psoriasis, mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test for a causal relationship with BMI. We used a genetic instrument comprising 97 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI as a proxy for BMI (expected to be much less confounded than measured BMI). One-sample MR was conducted using individual-level data (396,495 individuals) from the UK Biobank and the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), Norway. Two-sample MR was performed with summary-level data (356,926 individuals) from published BMI and psoriasis genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The one-sample and two-sample MR estimates were meta-analysed using a fixed-effect model. To test for a potential reverse causal effect, MR analysis with genetic instruments comprising variants from recent genome-wide analyses for psoriasis were used to test whether genetic risk for this skin disease has a causal effect on BMI. Published observational data showed an association of higher BMI with psoriasis. A mean difference in BMI of 1.26 kg/m2 (95% CI 1.02-1.51) between psoriasis cases and controls was observed in adults, while a 1.55 kg/m2 mean difference (95% CI 1.13-1.98) was observed in children. The observational association was confirmed in UK Biobank and HUNT data sets. Overall, a 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with 4% higher odds of psoriasis (meta-analysis odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; 95% CI 1.03-1.04; P = 1.73 x 10-60). MR analyses provided evidence that higher BMI causally increases the odds of psoriasis (by 9% per 1 unit increase in BMI; OR = 1.09 (1.06-1.12) per 1 kg/m2; P = 4.67 x 10-9). In contrast, MR estimates gave little support to a possible causal effect of psoriasis genetic risk on BMI (0.004 kg/m2 change in BMI per doubling odds of psoriasis (-0.003 to 0.011). Limitations of our study include possible misreporting of psoriasis by patients, as well as potential misdiagnosis by clinicians. In addition, there is also limited ethnic variation in the cohorts studied., CONCLUSIONS: Our study, using genetic variants as instrumental variables for BMI, provides evidence that higher BMI leads to a higher risk of psoriasis. This supports the prioritization of therapies and lifestyle interventions aimed at controlling weight for the prevention or treatment of this common skin disease. Mechanistic studies are required to improve understanding of this relationship.

AB  - Background: Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants, assumed to be instrumental variables for a particular exposure, to estimate the causal effect of that exposure on an outcome. If the instrumental variable criteria are satisfied, the resulting estimator is consistent even in the presence of unmeasured confounding and reverse causation. Methods: We extend the Mendelian randomization paradigm to investigate more complex networks of relationships between variables, in particular where some of the effect of an exposure on the outcome may operate through an intermediate variable (a mediator). If instrumental variables for the exposure and mediator are available, direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated, for example using either a regression-based method or structural equation models. The direction of effect between the exposure and a possible mediator can also be assessed. Methods are illustrated in an applied example considering causal relationships between body mass index, C-reactive protein and uric acid. Results: These estimators are consistent in the presence of unmeasured confounding if, in addition to the instrumental variable assumptions, the effects of both the exposure on the mediator and the mediator on the outcome are homogeneous across individuals and linear without interactions. Nevertheless, a simulation study demonstrates that even considerable heterogeneity in these effects does not lead to bias in the estimates. Conclusions: These methods can be used to estimate direct and indirect causal effects in a mediation setting, and have potential for the investigation of more complex networks between multiple interrelated exposures and disease outcomes.Copyright © The Author 2014; all rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Instrumental variable methods can estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome using observational data. Many instrumental variable methods assume that the exposure-outcome relation is linear, but in practice this assumption is often in doubt, or perhaps the shape of the relation is a target for investigation. We investigate this issue in the context of Mendelian randomization, the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables. Methods: Using simulations, we demonstrate the performance of a simple linear instrumental variable method when the true shape of the exposure-outcome relation is not linear. We also present a novel method for estimating the effect of the exposure on the outcome within strata of the exposure distribution. This enables the estimation of localized average causal effects within quantile groups of the exposure or as a continuous function of the exposure using a sliding window approach. Results: Our simulations suggest that linear instrumental variable estimates approximate a population-averaged causal effect. This is the average difference in the outcome if the exposure for every individual in the population is increased by a fixed amount. Estimates of localized average causal effects reveal the shape of the exposureoutcome relation for a variety of models. These methods are used to investigate the relations between body mass index and a range of cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: Nonlinear exposure-outcome relations should not be a barrierto instrumental variable analyses. When the exposure-outcome relation is not linear, either a population-averaged causal effect or the shape of the exposure-outcome relation can be estimated.Copyright © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins..

AB  - Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. The total causal effect of a risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from intervening on the risk factor. This total causal effect may potentially encompass multiple mediating mechanisms. For a proposed mediator, the direct effect of the risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from a change in the risk factor, keeping the mediator constant. A difference between the total effect and the direct effect indicates that the causal pathway from the risk factor to the outcome acts at least in part via the mediator (an indirect effect). Here, we show that Mendelian randomization estimates of total and direct effects can be obtained using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor, mediator, and outcome, potentially from different data sources. We perform simulations to test the validity of this approach when there is unmeasured confounding and/or bidirectional effects between the risk factor and mediator. We illustrate this method using the relationship between age at menarche and risk of breast cancer, with body mass index (BMI) as a potential mediator. We show an inverse direct causal effect of age at menarche on risk of breast cancer (independent of BMI), and a positive indirect effect via BMI. In conclusion, multivariable Mendelian randomization using summarized genetic data provides a rapid and accessible analytic strategy that can be undertaken using publicly available data to better understand causal mechanisms.

AB  - A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is performed to analyze the causal effect of an exposure variable on a disease outcome in observational studies, by using genetic variants that affect the disease outcome only through the exposure variable. This method has recently gained popularity among epidemiologists given the success of genetic association studies. Many exposure variables of interest in epidemiological studies are time varying, for example, body mass index (BMI). Although longitudinal data have been collected in many cohort studies, current MR studies only use one measurement of a time-varying exposure variable, which cannot adequately capture the long-term time-varying information. We propose using the functional principal component analysis method to recover the underlying individual trajectory of the time-varying exposure from the sparsely and irregularly observed longitudinal data, and then conduct MR analysis using the recovered curves. We further propose two MR analysis methods. The first assumes a cumulative effect of the time-varying exposure variable on the disease risk, while the second assumes a time-varying genetic effect and employs functional regression models. We focus on statistical testing for a causal effect. Our simulation studies mimicking the real data show that the proposed functional data analysis based methods incorporating longitudinal data have substantial power gains compared to standard MR analysis using only one measurement. We used the Framingham Heart Study data to demonstrate the promising performance of the new methods as well as inconsistent results produced by the standard MR analysis that relies on a single measurement of the exposure at some arbitrary time point.

AB  - Body mass index (BMI) is inversely associated with lung cancer risk in observational studies, even though it increases the risk of several other cancers, which could indicate confounding by tobacco smoking or reverse causality. We used the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to circumvent these limitations of observational epidemiology by constructing a genetic instrument for BMI, based on results from the GIANT consortium, which was evaluated in relation to lung cancer risk using GWAS results on 16,572 lung cancer cases and 21,480 controls. Results were stratified by histological subtype, smoking status and sex. An increase of one standard deviation (SD) in BMI (4.65 Kg/m(2)) raised the risk for lung cancer overall (OR = 1.13; P = 0.10). This was driven by associations with squamous cell (SQ) carcinoma (OR = 1.45; P = 1.2 x 10(-3)) and small cell (SC) carcinoma (OR = 1.81; P = 0.01). An inverse trend was seen for adenocarcinoma (AD) (OR = 0.82; P = 0.06). In stratified analyses, a 1 SD increase in BMI was inversely associated with overall lung cancer in never smokers (OR = 0.50; P = 0.02). These results indicate that higher BMI may increase the risk of certain types of lung cancer, in particular SQ and SC carcinoma.

AB  - Background: Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include a cluster of metabolic conditions such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Given that these risk factors are correlated, separating out causal from confounded effects is challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables, may facilitate the identification of the metabolic drivers of pancreatic cancer., Methods: We identified genetic instruments for obesity, body shape, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes in order to evaluate their causal role in pancreatic cancer etiology. These instruments were analyzed in relation to risk using a likelihood-based MR approach within a series of 7110 pancreatic cancer patients and 7264 control subjects using genome-wide data from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Potential unknown pleiotropic effects were assessed using a weighted median approach and MR-Egger sensitivity analyses., Results: Results indicated a robust causal association of increasing body mass index (BMI) with pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.65, for each standard deviation increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]). There was also evidence that genetically increased fasting insulin levels were causally associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.63, per SD [44.4 pmol/L]). Notably, no evidence of a causal relationship was observed for type 2 diabetes, nor for dyslipidemia. Sensitivity analyses did not indicate that pleiotropy was an important source of bias., Conclusions: Our results suggest a causal role of BMI and fasting insulin in pancreatic cancer etiology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference influence smoking status and intensity., DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation study., SETTING: UK Biobank, with replication of results from the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) consortium., PARTICIPANTS: European descent participants from the UK Biobank cohort (n=372 791) and the TAG consortium (n=74 035)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of current and past smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, age of smoking initiation., RESULTS: The Mendelian randomisation analysis indicated that each standard deviation increment in body mass index (4.6) increased the risk of being a smoker (odds ratio 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.23), P<0.001). This association was replicated in the TAG consortium data (1.19 (1.06 to 1.33), P=0.003). Furthermore, each standard deviation increment in body mass index was estimated to increase smoking intensity by 0.88 cigarettes per day (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.26, P<0.001) in UK Biobank and 1.27 cigarettes per day in the TAG consortium (0.46 to 2.07, P=0.002). Similar results were also seen for body fat percentage and waist circumference in both UK Biobank and the TAG consortium data., CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that higher adiposity influences smoking behaviour and could have implications for the implementation of public health interventions aiming to reduce the prevalence of these important risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessing the relationship between lung cancer and metabolic conditions is challenging because of the confounding effect of tobacco. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables to assess causality, may help to identify the metabolic drivers of lung cancer., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified genetic instruments for potential metabolic risk factors and evaluated these in relation to risk using 29,266 lung cancer cases (including 11,273 adenocarcinomas, 7,426 squamous cell and 2,664 small cell cases) and 56,450 controls. The MR risk analysis suggested a causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on lung cancer risk for two of the three major histological subtypes, with evidence of a risk increase for squamous cell carcinoma (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.20 [1.01-1.43] and for small cell lung cancer (OR [95%CI] = 1.52 [1.15-2.00]) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]), but not for adenocarcinoma (OR [95%CI] = 0.93 [0.79-1.08]) (Pheterogeneity = 4.3x10-3). Additional analysis using a genetic instrument for BMI showed that each SD increase in BMI increased cigarette consumption by 1.27 cigarettes per day (P = 2.1x10-3), providing novel evidence that a genetic susceptibility to obesity influences smoking patterns. There was also evidence that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inversely associated with lung cancer overall risk (OR [95%CI] = 0.90 [0.84-0.97] per SD of 38 mg/dl), while fasting insulin was positively associated (OR [95%CI] = 1.63 [1.25-2.13] per SD of 44.4 pmol/l). Sensitivity analyses including a weighted-median approach and MR-Egger test did not detect other pleiotropic effects biasing the main results., CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with a causal role of fasting insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in lung cancer etiology, as well as for BMI in squamous cell and small cell carcinoma. The latter relation may be mediated by a previously unrecognized effect of obesity on smoking behavior.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have convincingly demonstrated that several factors of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) are associated with the risk of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)These factors often occur together and it is therefore challenging to disentangle their individual causal relevance in the etiology of RCC. In order to circumvent this limitation, we have applied a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach whereby genetic markers are evaluated in relation to RCC risk as unconfounded markers of the individual MetS factors. We focused on MetS parameters from which genetic instruments could be identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The following MetS factors were instrumented using multiple genevariants: general and central obesity (body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio), elevated blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure), dyslipidemia (high and low density cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides), hyperglycemia (fasting glucose and glucose levels at 2 hours after glucose intolerance tests), and hyperinsulinemia (fasting insulin). Genetic proxies for these parameters were identified from GIANT, ICBP, GLGC and MAGIC Consortia. Summary statistics on RCC risk for instrumental SNPs of each MetS factor, including OR estimates and standard errors, were available from GWAS coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the US National Cancer Institute, the Institute for Cancer Research UK, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center US. Together these studies comprised a total of 12,104 RCC cases and 24,999 controls from European origin that were genotyped using different genotyping platforms. Imputation was conducted on each dataset and only SNPs with an imputation quality higher than 0.6 were considered for the analyses. The causal effect of each MetS parameter on RCC risk was subsequently estimated using the MR likelihood-based approach, assuming a linear relationship between the risk factor and the outcome and a bivariate normal distribution for the genetic association estimates. The MR risk analysis using genetic instruments of the individual MetS factors indicated that elevated BMI (P: 1x10-08) and fasting insulin (P: 7x10-04) increased the risk of RCC, whereas elevated postload glucose levels were associated with a lower risk (P: 2x10-3). The odds ratio per standard deviation increase were estimated at 1.58 (95% CI: 1.35-1.86) for BMI, 1.77 (95%CI: 1.27-2.46) for fasting insulin, and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.46-0.83) for postload glucose. No associations were seen for genetic instruments of blood pressure or lipids. These results provide a clear support for a causal role of obesity in RCC etiology, and suggest that factors related to hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia may be involved in the causal pathway. This study may guide future efforts aiming to clarify the biological mechanisms whereby the metabolic syndrome influences RCC pathogenesis.

AB  - Background Body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption are suggested to independently and interactively increase the risk of liver disease. We assessed this combined effect using factorial Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods We used multivariable adjusted regression and MR to estimate individual and joint associations of BMI and alcohol consumption and liver disease biomarkers (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT)) and incident liver disease. We undertook a factorial MR study splitting participants by median of measured BMI or BMI allele score then by median of reported alcohol consumption or ADH1B genotype (AA/AG and GG), giving four groups; low BMI/low alcohol (−BMI/−alc), low BMI/high alcohol (−BMI/+alc), high BMI/low alcohol (+BMI/−alc) and high BMI/high alcohol (+BMI/+alc). Results Individual positive associations of BMI and alcohol with ALT, GGT and incident liver disease were found. In the factorial MR analyses, considering the +BMI/+alc group as the reference, mean circulating ALT and GGT levels were lowest in the −BMI/−alc group (−2.32% (95% CI: −4.29, −0.35) and −3.56% (95% CI: −5.88, −1.24) for ALT and GGT respectively). Individuals with −BMI/+alc and +BMI/−alc had lower mean circulating ALT and GGT compared to the reference group (+BMI/+alc). For incident liver disease multivariable factorial analyses followed a similar pattern to those seen for the biomarkers, but little evidence of differences between MR factorial categories for odds of liver disease. Conclusions Consistent results from multivariable regression and MR analysis, provides compelling evidence for the individual adverse effects of BMI and alcohol consumption on liver disease. Intervening on both BMI and alcohol may improve the profiles of circulating liver biomarkers. However, this may not reduce clinical liver disease risk.

AB  - Background: Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We therefore tested associations of sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRSs) for body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) with leading causes of mortality, using a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. Methods and Findings: We constructed sex-specific GRSs for BMI, WHR, and WHRadjBMI, including 565, 324, and 338 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality using an MR design in up to 422,414 participants from the UK Biobank. We also investigated associations with potential mediators and risk factors, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (P-het). Up to 227,717 women and 194,697 men with mean (standard deviation) age 56.6 (7.9) and 57.0 (8.1) years, body mass index 27.0 (5.1) and 27.9 (4.2) kg/m2 and waist-hip-ratio 0.82 (0.07) and 0.94 (0.07), respectively, were included. Mendelian randomization analysis showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. A 1 standard deviation higher body mass index led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women (OR 3.81; 95% CI 3.42-4.25, P=8.9x10-130) than in men (OR 2.78; 95% CI 2.57-3.02, P=1.0x10-133, P-het=5.1x10-6). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P-het=5.5x10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (P-het=1.3x10-4) in men than women. A limitation of MR studies is potential bias if the genetic variants are directly associated with confounders (pleiotropy), but sensitivity analyses such as MR-Egger supported the main findings. Our study was also limited to people of European descent and results may differ in people of other ancestries. Conclusions: Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have implications on public health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing globally. One hypothesis is that increasing childhood obesity rates may explain part of this increase, but, as T1D is rare, intervention studies are challenging to perform. The aim of this study was to assess this hypothesis with a Mendelian randomization approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to test for causal associations., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a genetic instrument of 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with childhood adiposity in children aged 2-10 years. Summary-level association results for these 23 SNPs with childhood-onset (<17 years) T1D were extracted from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study with 5,913 T1D cases and 8,828 reference samples. Using inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization analysis, we found support for an effect of childhood adiposity on T1D risk (odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.06-1.64 per standard deviation score in body mass index [SDS-BMI]). A sensitivity analysis provided evidence of horizontal pleiotropy bias (p = 0.04) diluting the estimates towards the null. We therefore applied Egger regression and multivariable Mendelian randomization methods to control for this type of bias and found evidence in support of a role of childhood adiposity in T1D (odds ratio in Egger regression, 2.76, 95% CI 1.40-5.44). Limitations of our study include that underlying genes and their mechanisms for most of the genetic variants included in the score are not known. Mendelian randomization requires large sample sizes, and power was limited to provide precise estimates. This research has been conducted using data from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium, the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium, the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) Consortium, and the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC), as well as meta-analysis results from a T1D genome-wide association study., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides genetic support for a link between childhood adiposity and T1D risk. Together with evidence from observational studies, our findings further emphasize the importance of measures to reduce the global epidemic of childhood obesity and encourage mechanistic studies.

AB  - Introduction: Observational studies have identified an association between body mass index (BMI) and incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Inferring causality from observational studies, however, is subject to residual confounding and bias. Objective: To utilize BMI-associated genetic variation to evaluate the causality of the association between BMI and AF. Methods: Mendelian randomization with instrumental variable analysis was used to estimate cohortspecific causal hazard ratios for the association between BMI and AF in a total of 51,646 individuals from seven prospective population-based cohorts from the United States, Iceland, and the Netherlands. 4,178 cases of incident AF were ascertained between 1987 and 2012. Exposures included BMI measured at study baseline and a genetic instrument (BMI gene score) comprised of 39 SNPs associated with BMI in GWAS. Cohort specific estimates were combined by random-effects, inverse variance weighted metaanalysis. Results: In age and sex-adjusted analyses, BMI was significantly associated with incident AF [HR= 1.05 per kg/m2 (95% CI: 1.04-1.06); p<0.001]. A one unit increase in BMI gene score was equivalent to 1.05 kg/m2 in BMI (95% CI: 0.90-1.20; p<0.001), and the BMI gene score was significantly associated with incident AF [HR: 1.11 per 1-unit increase (95% CI: 1.05-1.18); p<0.001]. Adjustment for measured BMI attenuated the association between the BMI gene score and incident AF [HR 1.05 per 1-unit increase (95% CI: 0.99-1.12); p=0.06]. The meta-analyzed instrumental variable estimate for the causal association between BMI and incident AF was HR 1.11 per kg/m2 (95% CI: 1.05-1.17; p<0.001). (Figure). Multivariable adjustment did not substantially alter any of the findings. Conclusions: These data support a causal link between increased BMI and incident AF. Public health initiatives targeting primordial prevention of obesity and weight reduction have the potential to significantly reduce AF incidence. (Table Presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have identified an association between body mass index (BMI) and incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Inferring causality from observational studies, however, is subject to residual confounding, reverse causation, and bias. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the causal association between BMI and AF by using genetic predictors of BMI., METHODS: We identified 51 646 individuals of European ancestry without AF at baseline from 7 prospective population-based cohorts initiated between 1987 and 2002 in the United States, Iceland, and the Netherlands with incident AF ascertained between 1987 and 2012. Cohort-specific mean follow-up ranged from 7.4 to 19.2 years, over which period there was a total of 4178 cases of incident AF. We performed a Mendelian randomization with instrumental variable analysis to estimate a cohort-specific causal hazard ratio for the association between BMI and AF. Two genetic instruments for BMI were used: FTO genotype (rs1558902) and a BMI gene score comprising 39 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide association studies to be associated with BMI. Cohort-specific estimates were combined by random-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis., RESULTS: In age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis, both genetic instruments were significantly associated with BMI (FTO: 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.54] kg/m2 per A-allele, P<0.001; BMI gene score: 1.05 [95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.20] kg/m2 per 1-U increase, P<0.001) and incident AF (FTO, hazard ratio, 1.07 [1.02-1.11] per A-allele, P=0.004; BMI gene score, hazard ratio, 1.11 [1.05-1.18] per 1-U increase, P<0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted instrumental variable estimates for the causal association between BMI and incident AF were hazard ratio, 1.15 (1.04-1.26) per kg/m2, P=0.005 (FTO) and 1.11 (1.05-1.17) per kg/m2, P<0.001 (BMI gene score). Both of these estimates were consistent with the meta-analyzed estimate between observed BMI and AF (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio 1.05 [1.04-1.06] per kg/m2, P<0.001). Multivariable adjustment did not significantly change findings., CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with a causal relationship between BMI and incident AF. These data support the possibility that public health initiatives targeting primordial prevention of obesity may reduce the incidence of AF. Copyright © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Aortic stenosis (AS) cases often have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, but whether these risk factors are causally implicated in disease development remains unclear. Genetic data, by leveraging the natural randomization of genetic material at conception, can provide insight into whether these risk factors causally contribute to AS. Methods: We estimated the observational association of seven cardiovascular risk factors with AS within the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort amongst 44,703 individuals of self-reported European ancestry, aged 55 years or older. AS status (n = 3,469 cases) was defined using diagnosis and procedure codes, and individuals with congenital valvular heart disease were excluded. Mendelian randomization, a method that can provide supportive evidence for causality using genetic data, was performed for 11 cardiovascular risk factors related to adiposity, blood pressure, lipids, and smoking. In sensitivity analyses, the Egger extension to Mendelian randomization was used to account for pleiotropy in the genetic instruments. Results: Male sex, age, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, hyperten-sion, dyslipidemia, and being a past or present smoker were associated with AS in separate logistic regression models adjusted for age, age2, and sex (all p < 0.05). These risk factors remained significant following further adjustment for dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes. Genetic risk scores for systolic blood pressure (odds ratio [OR] per 10 mmHg, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04-1.37; p = 0.011), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR per SD, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11-1.46; p = 5.0 x 10-4) and triglycerides (OR per SD, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.08-1.49; p = 4.3 x 10-3) were associated with AS. In sensitivity analyses accounting for pleiotropy, genetic predisposition to either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides remained associated (OR per SD, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05-1.92; p = 0.024 and OR per SD, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.03-2.09; p = 0.033, respectively). However, genetic predisposition to systolic blood pressure was no longer associated with AS. Conclusions: Although several traditional cardiovascular risk factors were observationally associated with AS, our genetic analyses provide sup-portive evidence for a causal association for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and possibly systolic blood pressure. Further investigation is required to determine their potential as therapeutic targets.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity and asthma are common chronic diseases in children and have been reported to be mutually causative. We investigated the causality and direction of the relationship between adiposity and asthma using genetic markers as instrumental variables (IVs) in bi-directional Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis. Methods: We used data from the Taiwan Children Health Study with 24 body mass index (BMI)-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, combined into a weighted allelic score) and 16 asthma-SNPs (combined into two weighted allelic scores, separately for asthma inflammatory and antioxidative genes) to yield genetic IVs for adiposity and asthma, respectively. 2525 children aged 11-12 years with available data on adiposity, genotyping, and asthma were included. We used the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method to estimate the causal direction between adiposity and asthma. Results: The weighted allele score for BMI was strongly associated with adiposity (p < 0.001) and active asthma (p = 0.03). The two-stage least square regression risk ratio (RR) for the effect of BMI on asthma was 1.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.07, p = 0.03). Although the weighted asthma genetic scores were significantly associated with asthma (p < 0.01), no association was seen for genetically instrumented asthma with BMI using MR. Central obesity was the most accurate predictor of asthma. This causal effect was significant for non-atopic asthma compared with atopic asthma and was significantly stronger in boys than in girls. Causal effect estimates were similar while omitting FTO locus from the genetic score. Sensitivity analysis for MR revealed no directional genetic pleiotropy effects. The causal effect RRs of BMI on asthma were 1.04, 1.08, and 1.03 for inverse-variance-weighted, MR-Egger regression (slope), and weighted median Methods, respectively, all in accordance with the MR estimates. Conclusion: On the basis of a bi-directional MR approach, our study demonstrated that high adiposity leads to asthma, whereas the effects of asthma on adiposity accumulation are likely to be small.

AB  - Background: In Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, variants that exert horizontal pleiotropy, influencing the outcome through a pathway excluding the hypothesised exposure, are typically treated as a nuisance. However, they could provide valuable information for identifying novel pathways to the traits under investigation. Methods: Following the advice of William Bateson to "TReasure Your eXceptions", we developed the MR-TRYX framework. Here, we begin by detecting outliers in a single exposure-outcome MR analysis. Outliers are hypothesised to arise due to horizontal pleiotropy, so we search through the MR-Base database of GWAS summary statistics to systematically identify other ("candidate") traits that associate with the outliers. We developed a LASSO-based multivariable MR approach to model the heterogeneity in the exposure-outcome analysis due to pathways through candidate traits. Results: Through simulations we showed that commonly used outlier removal methods can increase type 1 error rates, but adjustment for detected pleiotropic pathways can improve power without the increase in type 1 error rates. We illustrate the use of MR-TRYX through investigation of several causal relationships: i) systolic blood pressure on coronary heart disease (CHD); ii) urate on CHD; iii) sleep duration on schizophrenia; and iv) education level on body mass index. Many pleiotropic pathways were uncovered with already established causal effects, validating the approach. Novel putative causal pathways, such as pain related phenotypes influencing CHD, were also identified. Adjustment for these pleiotropic pathways substantially reduced the heterogeneity across the analyses. Conclusion: Incorporating GWAS on thousands of traits in MR-Base to model horizontal pleiotropy in MR analysis can improve power through reducing heterogeneity, whilst enabling the identification of novel causal relationships.

AB  - Introduction: Decreasing trend of age at menarche has been reported globally. Early menarche is known to be a major risk factor for early sexual debut, adolescent pregnancy, premature menopause and breast cancer. Although the exact mechanism which triggers the initiation of puberty is not clear, adolescence obesity is suggested to play a role in this reproductive transition. The purpose of this study was to explore the causal relationship between adolescence body mass index (BMI) and early menarche. Materials and Methods: Data of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (Ko-GES) conducted from 2004 to 2013 were used. Early menarche was statistically defned considering the general trend of lowering age at menarche. Among the women who reported their age at menar-che and body weight at the age of 18-20 years, those whose age at menarche was below the 3th percentile for the population of the same birth cohort were classifed to have early menarche. We replicated a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of early menarche and adolescence BMI in the study population. Results: A total of 118, 623 Korean women who aged >= 20 years were included in the analysis. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the risk of early menarche increased with higher adolescent BMI (Adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, 95% confdence interval [CI], [1.19, 1.37]). Using a genetic risk score to indicate early menarche, we found that higher risk of early menarche with increasing of adolescence BMI (adjusted OR = 1.003, 95% CI [1.000, 1.067]). Conclusion:This fnding suggests a possible causal relationship between higher ado-lescence BMI and increased risk of early menarche.

AB  - Risk-taking propensity is a trait of significant public health relevance but few specific genetic factors are known. Here we perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported risk-taking propensity among 436,236 white European UK Biobank study participants. We identify genome-wide associations at 26 loci (P < 5 x 10-8), 24 of which are novel, implicating genes enriched in the GABA and GABA receptor pathways. Modelling the relationship between risk-taking propensity and body mass index (BMI) using Mendelian randomisation shows a positive association (0.25 approximate SDs of BMI (SE: 0.06); P = 6.7 x 10-5). The impact of individual SNPs is heterogeneous, indicating a complex relationship arising from multiple shared pathways. We identify positive genetic correlations between risk-taking and waist-hip ratio, childhood obesity, ever smoking, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, alongside a negative correlation with women's age at first birth. These findings highlight that behavioural pathways involved in risk-taking propensity may play a role in obesity, smoking and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: Observational studies suggest that obesity is associated with increased risk of asthma. However, it is unknown whether this could be explained by wheezing. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that observational and genetic high body mass index(BMI) are associated with wheezing and asthma. Methods: We genotyped 86,019 individuals aged 20-100 years from the Copenhagen General Population Study for FTO(rs9939609), MC4R(rs17782313), and TMEM18(rs6548238); 13,908 individuals experienced wheezing and 5,612 had asthma. Wheezing was self-reported, and asthma was ascertained through self-report, hospital contacts with asthma, and/or receiving medication for asthma. Results: In observational analyses versus BMI of 18.5-22.4kg/ m2, odds ratios(ORs) for wheezing were 2.68(95% confidence interval:2.49-2.88) for BMI of 3034.9kg/ m2, 4.20(3.79-4.66) for 3539.9kg/ m2, and 6.45(5.46-7.61) for BMI>=40kg/m2 . Corresponding ORs for asthma were 1.46(1.32-1.62), 1.60(1.37-1.88), and 2.05(1.61-2.62), respectively. Compared with BMI allele score 0-2, score 3 and 46 were associated with 0.30 and 0.67kg/m2 higher BMI. In genetic analyses versus allele score 0-2, ORs for wheezing were 1.05(1.01-1.10) and 1.11(1.0-61.17) for allele score 3 and 46. Corresponding ORs for asthma were 1.02(0.95-1.08) and 1.02(0.95-1.10). Genetically determined ORs per unit higher BMI were 1.17(1.09-1.25) for wheezing and 1.03(0.93-1.14) for asthma. Corresponding observational ORs were 1.10(1.09-1.10) and 1.03(1.03-1.04). Conclusions: Genetically high BMI was associated with wheezing, but not with asthma. Thus, these findings suggest that asthma may be mis-diagnosed based on wheezing in many obese individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that obesity is associated with increased risk of asthma. However, it is unknown whether this could be explained by wheezing. We tested the hypothesis that high body mass index (BMI) observationally and genetically is associated with high risk of wheezing and asthma, and that the association between high BMI and asthma is explained by wheezing., METHODS: We genotyped 85,437 individuals aged 20-100 years from the Copenhagen General Population Study for FTO (rs9939609), MC4R (rs17782313), TMEM18 (rs6548238) GNPDA2 (rs10938397) and BDNF (rs10767664); 14,500 individuals experienced wheezing and 5406 had asthma. Wheezing was self-reported, and asthma was ascertained through self-report, hospital contacts with asthma, and/or receiving medication for asthma. BMI was calculated as measured weight divided by measured height squared (kg/m2)., RESULTS: In observational analyses versus BMI of 18.5-22.4 kg/m2, ORs for wheezing were 1.23 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.52) for BMI <18.5 kg/m2, 1.17 (1.10 to 1.25) for 22.5-24.9 kg/m2, 1.44 (1.35 to 1.54) for 25-27.4 kg/m2, 1.86 (1.73 to 1.99) for 27.5-29.9 kg/m2, 2.48 (2.31 to 2.66) for 30-34.9 kg/m(2), 3.86 (3.48 to 4.28) for 35-39.9 kg/m2 and 6.05 (5.12 to 7.14) for BMI >=40 kg/m2. Corresponding ORs for asthma were 1.28 (0.95 to 1.74), 1.07 (0.97 to 1.17), 1.14 (1.04 to 1.25), 1.32 (1.20 to 1.46), 1.39 (1.25 to 1.54), 1.54 (1.31 to 1.81) and 1.99 (1.55 to 2.56), respectively. Compared with BMI allele score 0-4, scores 5, 6 and 7-10 were associated with 0.22, 0.51 and 0.76 kg/m2 higher BMI, respectively. Genetically determined ORs per unit higher BMI were 1.22 (1.15 to 1.31) for wheezing, 1.18 (1.10 to 1.27) for wheezing without asthma, 1.08 (0.98 to 1.19) for asthma, and 0.85 (0.73 to 0.99) for asthma without wheezing. Corresponding observational ORs were 1.09 (1.09 to 1.10), 1.09 (1.08 to 1.09), 1.03 (1.03 to 1.04) and 0.99 (0.98 to 1.00), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: High BMI was associated with high risk of wheezing without asthma, but not with high risk of asthma without wheezing.

AB  - There is ongoing controversy as to whether obesity confers risk for CAD independently of associated risk factors including diabetes mellitus. We have carried out a Mendelian randomization study using a genetic risk score (GRS) for body mass index (BMI) based on 35 risk alleles to investigate this question in a population of 5831 early onset CAD cases without diabetes mellitus and 3832 elderly healthy control subjects, all of strictly European ancestry, with adjustment for traditional risk factors (TRFs). We then estimated the genetic correlation between these BMI and CAD (rg) by relating the pairwise genetic similarity matrix to a phenotypic covariance matrix between these two traits. GRSBMI significantly (P=2.12 x 10(-12)) associated with CAD status in a multivariate model adjusted for TRFs, with a per allele odds ratio (OR) of 1.06 (95% CI 1.042-1.076). The addition of GRSBMI to TRFs explained 0.75% of CAD variance and yielded a continuous net recombination index of 16.54% (95% CI=11.82-21.26%, P<0.0001). To test whether GRSBMI explained CAD status when adjusted for measured BMI, separate models were constructed in which the score and BMI were either included as covariates or not. The addition of BMI explained ~1.9% of CAD variance and GRSBMI plus BMI explained 2.65% of CAD variance. Finally, using bivariate restricted maximum likelihood analysis, we provide strong evidence of genome-wide pleiotropy between obesity and CAD. This analysis supports the hypothesis that obesity is a causal risk factor for CAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent advances in data analysis methods based on principles of Mendelian Randomisation, such as Egger regression and the weighted median estimator, add to the researcher's ability to infer cause-effect links from observational data. Now is the time to gauge the potential of these methods within specific areas of biomedical research. In this paper, we choose a study in metabolomics as an illustrative testbed. We apply Mendelian Randomisation methods in the analysis of data from the DILGOM (Dietary, Lifestyle and Genetic determinants of Obesity and Metabolic syndrome) study, in the context of an effort to identify molecular pathways of cardiovascular disease. In particular, our illustrative analysis addresses the question whether body mass, as measured by body mass index (BMI), exerts a causal effect on the concentrations of a collection of 137 cardiometabolic markers with different degrees of atherogenic power, such as the (highly atherogenic) lipoprotein metabolites with very low density (VLDLs) and the (protective) high density lipoprotein metabolites., RESULTS: We found strongest evidence of a positive BMI effect (that is, evidence that an increase in BMI causes an increase in the metabolite concentration) on those metabolites known to represent strong risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as the VLDLs, and evidence of a negative effect on protective biomarkers., CONCLUSIONS: The methods discussed represent a useful scientific tool, although they assume the validity of conditions that are (at best) only partially verifiable. This paper provides a rigorous account of such conditions. The results of our analysis provide a proof-of-concept illustration of the potential usefulness of Mendelian Randomisation in genomic biobank studies aiming to dissect the molecular causes of disease, and to identify candidate pharmacological targets.

AB  - Background: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a thrombus/clot in the deep veins, when part of this clot breaks off it can travel to the lungs, resulting in pulmonary embolism. These two conditions together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE), a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Despite the prevalence of VTE, we do not fully understand what causes it and it is often overlooked as a major public health problem. Confirming and identifying risk factors associated with DVT is likely to lead to a reduction in the incidence, morbidity and mortality of VTE especially where these risk factors are modifiable. We can do this, by exploiting the availability of summary genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of numerous phenotypes, including DVT, which permits hypothesis-free causal inference. Objectives: To identify novel risk factors for DVT and to assess the causality of factors previously shown to be associated with DVT. Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed using summarised genetic data. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) estimates were calculated and validated by additional methods more robust to horizontal pleiotropy (MR Egger, simple mode, weighted mode, and weighted median). Bidirectional and heterogeneity sensitivity analyses were performed to further evaluate our findings. Results: Forty-seven exposures passed an exposure-exposure correlation-adjusted Bonferroni P-value threshold (5.43E-05). These included previously hypothesised risk factors for DVT (e.g. body mass index, varicose veins, height, hyperthyroidism) and novel associations (e.g. prospective memory, basal metabolic rate). Conclusion: Our analyses confirmed causal associations of risk factors previously associated with DVT and highlighted several novel risk factors for the disease. Our study demonstrates the utility of using a hypothesis free Mendelian randomization approach for the identification of novel disease risk factors.

AB  - This study focused on resolving the relationship between BMI and type 2 diabetes. The availability of multiple variants associated with BMI offers a new chance to resolve the true causal effect of BMI on type 2 diabetes; however, the properties of these associations and their validity as genetic instruments need to be considered alongside established and new methods for undertaking Mendelian randomization (MR). We explore the potential for pleiotropic genetic variants to generate bias, revise existing estimates, and illustrate value in new analysis methods. A two-sample MR approach with 96 genetic variants was used with three different analysis methods, two of which (MR-Egger and the weighted median) have been developed specifically to address problems of invalid instrumental variables. We estimate an odds ratio for type 2 diabetes per unit increase in BMI (kg/m(2)) of between 1.19 and 1.38, with the most stable estimate using all instruments and a weighted median approach (1.26 [95% CI 1.17, 1.34]). TCF7L2(rs7903146) was identified as a complex effect or pleiotropic instrument, and removal of this variant resulted in convergence of causal effect estimates from different causal analysis methods. This indicated the potential for pleiotropy to affect estimates and differences in performance of alternative analytical methods. In a real type 2 diabetes-focused example, this study demonstrates the potential impact of invalid instruments on causal effect estimates and the potential for new approaches to mitigate the bias caused.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The implications of different adiposity measures on cardiovascular disease etiology remain unclear. In this article, we quantify and contrast causal associations of central adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index [WHRadjBMI]) and general adiposity (body mass index [BMI]) with cardiometabolic disease., METHODS: Ninety-seven independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms for BMI and 49 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for WHRadjBMI were used to conduct Mendelian randomization analyses in 14 prospective studies supplemented with coronary heart disease (CHD) data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics; combined total 66 842 cases), stroke from METASTROKE (12 389 ischemic stroke cases), type 2 diabetes mellitus from DIAGRAM (Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis; 34 840 cases), and lipids from GLGC (Global Lipids Genetic Consortium; 213 500 participants) consortia. Primary outcomes were CHD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major stroke subtypes; secondary analyses included 18 cardiometabolic traits., RESULTS: Each one standard deviation (SD) higher WHRadjBMI (1 SD=0.08 U) associated with a 48% excess risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR] for CHD, 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.71), similar to findings for BMI (1 SD=4.6 kg/m2; OR for CHD, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.22-1.52). Only WHRadjBMI increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03-1.70). For type 2 diabetes mellitus, both measures had large effects: OR, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.38-2.42) and OR, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.41-2.78) per 1 SD higher WHRadjBMI and BMI, respectively. Both WHRadjBMI and BMI were associated with higher left ventricular hypertrophy, glycemic traits, interleukin 6, and circulating lipids. WHRadjBMI was also associated with higher carotid intima-media thickness (39%; 95% CI, 9%-77% per 1 SD)., CONCLUSIONS: Both general and central adiposity have causal effects on CHD and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Central adiposity may have a stronger effect on stroke risk. Future estimates of the burden of adiposity on health should include measures of central and general adiposity.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) shares with bone metabolism the activity of pleiotropic osteokines involved in the atherosclerotic process, including osteoprotegerin (OPG) and RANK-ligand (RANKL). Since the relationship of the OPG/ RANKL system with T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk might rec-ognize a genetic signature, we verified the association of 18 variants (SNP, capturing >96% of genetic variation) at OPG (12) and RANKL (6) loci with respective OPG and RANKL levels in 794 (M/F=542/252) VNDS participants (meanSEM, age=58.2+/-0.4 years; BMI=30.2+/-0.2 Kg/m2;HbA1c=6.9+/-0.02%). We also assessed: insulin sensitivity (IS), by insulin clamp; beta-cell function components (BF), by 5h-OGTT minimal modeling; subclinical atherosclerosis (SCA), by US-scan of common carotid (CC) and lower limbs arteries (LL); ECG. We tested the association of individual SNPs with IS and BF by linear models (M1: age, sex, BMI adjusted), and by logistic regressions in case of ECG and SCA (M2=M1+smoke). FDR=0.05, according to Benjamini- Hochberg. In bivariate analysis, OPG (338 [252-456] pg/mL) and RANKL (84.9 [48.0-136.8)] levels were inversely related (rho=-0.26, p<0.001). OPG was associated with impaired IS (Bstd=-0.12, p<0.001) and BF (proportional component, Bstd=-0.10, p<0.01); RANKL was associated with CC-SCA (OR=1.005 [1.003-1.008], p<0.001), CC-LL (1.002 [1-1.004], p=0.003) and altered ECG (1.002 [1-1.004], p=0.025). Seven OPG-SNPs were associated with both OPG levels and BF (p<0.05), but not with IS or CVD risk traits. No association was found between RANKL-SNPs and outcome phenotypes. In a Mendelian randomization design, OPG levels (instrumental variables: 7 OPG-SNPs) were not significantly related to BF (p=0.29-0.18). Hence, OPG levels appear not to be causally linked to BF. Further analyses extended to the whole set of osteokines are warranted to elucidate the pathophysiologic determinants linking T2D, SCA and bone metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest a potential role for obesity and determinants of adult stature in prostate cancer risk and mortality, but the relationships described in the literature are complex. To address uncertainty over the causal nature of previous observational findings, we investigated associations of height- and adiposity-related genetic variants with prostate cancer risk and mortality., METHODS: We conducted a case-control study based on 20,848 prostate cancers and 20,214 controls of European ancestry from 22 studies in the PRACTICAL consortium. We constructed genetic risk scores that summed each man's number of height and BMI increasing alleles across multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms robustly associated with each phenotype from published genome-wide association studies., RESULTS: The genetic risk scores explained 6.31 and 1.46% of the variability in height and BMI, respectively. There was only weak evidence that genetic variants previously associated with increased BMI were associated with a lower prostate cancer risk (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in BMI genetic score 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 1.00; p = 0.07). Genetic variants associated with increased height were not associated with prostate cancer incidence (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97, 1.01; p = 0.23), but were associated with an increase (OR 1.13; 95 % CI 1.08, 1.20) in prostate cancer mortality among low-grade disease (p heterogeneity, low vs. high grade <0.001). Genetic variants associated with increased BMI were associated with an increase (OR 1.08; 95 % CI 1.03, 1.14) in all-cause mortality among men with low-grade disease (p heterogeneity = 0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence of a substantial effect of genetically elevated height or BMI on prostate cancer risk, suggesting that previously reported observational associations may reflect common environmental determinants of height or BMI and prostate cancer risk. Genetically elevated height and BMI were associated with increased mortality (prostate cancer-specific and all-cause, respectively) in men with low-grade disease, a potentially informative but novel finding that requires replication.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Affected women frequently have metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. PCOS is diagnosed with two different sets of diagnostic criteria, resulting in a phenotypic spectrum of PCOS cases. The genetic similarities between cases diagnosed based on the two criteria have been largely unknown. Previous studies in Chinese and European subjects have identified 16 loci associated with risk of PCOS. We report a fixed-effect, inverse-weighted-variance meta-analysis from 10,074 PCOS cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry and characterisation of PCOS related traits. We identified 3 novel loci (near PLGRKT, ZBTB16 and MAPRE1), and provide replication of 11 previously reported loci. Only one locus differed significantly in its association by diagnostic criteria; otherwise the genetic architecture was similar between PCOS diagnosed by self-report and PCOS diagnosed by NIH or non-NIH Rotterdam criteria across common variants at 13 loci. Identified variants were associated with hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin regulation and testosterone levels in affected women. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis revealed genetic correlations with obesity, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels and coronary artery disease, indicating shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and PCOS. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested variants associated with body mass index, fasting insulin, menopause timing, depression and male-pattern balding play a causal role in PCOS. The data thus demonstrate 3 novel loci associated with PCOS and similar genetic architecture for all diagnostic criteria. The data also provide the first genetic evidence for a male phenotype for PCOS and a causal link to depression, a previously hypothesized comorbid disease. Thus, the genetics provide a comprehensive view of PCOS that encompasses multiple diagnostic criteria, gender, reproductive potential and mental health.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Affected women frequently have metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. PCOS is diagnosed with two different sets of diagnostic criteria, resulting in a phenotypic spectrum of PCOS cases. The genetic similarities between cases diagnosed with different criteria have been largely unknown. Previous studies in Chinese and European subjects have identified 16 loci associated with risk of PCOS. We report a meta-analysis from 10,074 PCOS cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry and characterisation of PCOS related traits. We identified 3 novel loci (near PLGRKT, ZBTB16 and MAPRE1), and provide replication of 11 previously reported loci. Identified variants were associated with hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin regulation and testosterone levels in affected women. Genetic correlations with obesity, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels and coronary artery disease indicate shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and PCOS. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested variants associated with body mass index, fasting insulin, menopause timing, depression and male-pattern balding play a causal role in PCOS. Only one locus differed in its association by diagnostic criteria, otherwise the genetic architecture was similar between PCOS diagnosed by self-report and PCOS diagnosed by NIH or Rotterdam criteria across common variants at 13 loci.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive disorder in women, yet there is little consensus regarding its aetiology. Here we perform a genome-wide association study of PCOS in up to 5,184 self-reported cases of White European ancestry and 82,759 controls, with follow-up in a further ~2,000 clinically validated cases and ~100,000 controls. We identify six signals for PCOS at genome-wide statistical significance (P<5 x 10(-8)), in/near genes ERBB4/HER4, YAP1, THADA, FSHB, RAD50 and KRR1. Variants in/near three of the four epidermal growth factor receptor genes (ERBB2/HER2, ERBB3/HER3 and ERBB4/HER4) are associated with PCOS at or near genome-wide significance. Mendelian randomization analyses indicate causal roles in PCOS aetiology for higher BMI (P=2.5 x 10(-9)), higher insulin resistance (P=6 x 10(-4)) and lower serum sex hormone binding globulin concentrations (P=5 x 10(-4)). Furthermore, genetic susceptibility to later menopause is associated with higher PCOS risk (P=1.6 x 10(-8)) and PCOS-susceptibility alleles are associated with higher serum anti-Mullerian hormone concentrations in girls (P=8.9 x 10(-5)). This large-scale study implicates an aetiological role of the epidermal growth factor receptors, infers causal mechanisms relevant to clinical management and prevention, and suggests balancing selection mechanisms involved in PCOS risk.

AB  - We investigated the relationship of anthropometric markers of obesity with quantitative magnetic resonance imaging markers of brain aging, including measures of total brain volume (TBV), gray matter volume (GMV), hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), and brain infarcts, and examined causality using Mendelian randomization (MR). Analyses were performed in 1779 individuals (60.4% women, 72.8 +/- 4.1 years of age) from the 3C-Dijon population-based cohort study (N = 1555 for the MR). Larger waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR) and waist circumference (WC) were associated with lower TBV (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.005), and lower GMV (p = 0.0008 and p = 0.003), independently of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and vascular risk factors. Higher BMI, WC, and WHR were associated with larger WMHV and WC with brain infarcts, before adjusting for vascular risk factors only. We used MR to investigate the inverse relationship between WHR and GMV. One valid instrumental variable was available in women only (rs6905288), which was associated with GMV (p = 0.015). Age and BMI-adjusted effect estimates from the MR analysis confirmed the inverse association between GMV and WHR and are in favor of a causal association. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Obesity is associated with substantial morbidity, costs, and decreased life expectancy, and continues to rise worldwide. While etiological understanding is needed for prevention, epidemiological studies indicated that colonization with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) may affect body mass index (BMI), but with inconsistent results. Here, we examine the relationship between H. pylori colonization and BMI/obesity. Cross-sectional analyses were performed in two independent population-based cohorts of elderly from the Netherlands and Germany (n = 13,044). Genetic risk scores were conducted based on genetic loci associated with either H. pylori colonization or BMI/obesity. We performed a bi-directional Mendelian randomization. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional data revealed no association between anti-H. pylori IgG titer and BMI, nor of H. pylori positivity and BMI. Anti-H. pylori IgG titer was negatively associated with obesity (OR 0.99972; 95% CI 0.99946-0.99997, p = 0.03) and with obesity classes (Beta -6.91 *10-5; 95% CI -1.38*10-4, -5.49*10-7, p = 0.048), but the magnitude of these effects was limited. Mendelian randomization showed no causal relation between H. pylori genetic risk score and BMI/obesity, nor between BMI or obesity genetic risk scores and H. pylori positivity. This study provides no evidence for a clinically relevant association between H. pylori and BMI/obesity.

AB  - Background and aims: While obesity is an established major risk factor for all-cause mortality in otherwise healthy individuals, its role in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is controversial. Our aim was to address the relationship between obesity and all-cause mortality in a real-life set of White patients with T2D from central-southern Italy. We also used genetic data from GWAs-derived SNPs firmly associated with BMI, in order to address the biology underlying the association between obesity and reduced mortality rate we did observe (i.e. Mendelian randomization approach). Materials and methods: Patients with T2D (n=764) are part of the Gargano Mortality Study, aimed at unraveling predictors of incident all-cause mortality. Time-to-death analyses were performed by Cox regression models. Of the 38 SNPs established associated to BMI in GWAs, we investigated those with a BMI beta value >=0.10 Kg/m2 and an allele frequency >=10% (n=20). Genotyping of established BMI SNPs from GWAs, was performed by KBioscience (http:// www.lgcgenomics.com/). Association between genotype risk score (GRS; number of risk allele carried by each individual) and obesity was tested by logistic regression analysis. Results: During the 7.46+/-2.13 year follow-up 149 (19.5%) patients died. Annual incidence rates were 2.6% in the whole sample, 3.4% in non-obese and 1.9%, in obese individuals. As compared to non obese, obese patients had 45% decreased risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0.55, 95% CI=0.40-0.76; p=0.0004; age, sex, smoking habit, hypertension and dyslipidemia adjusted HR=0.64, 95% CI=0.45-0.90, p=0.010). Individuals with high "obesity genetic load" (i.e. 10 SNP-derived GRS being >= 9, the median value of whole sample) were more likely to be obese (OR=1.61, 95% CI = 1.21-2.12, p=0.001) as compared to individuals with low "obesity genetic load" (i.e. 10 SNP-derived GRS being <9). Annual incidence rates of all-cause mortality were 2.65% and 2.58% in individuals with high and low "obesity genetic load", respectively. As compared to individuals with low "obesity genetic load", the HR for all-cause mortality in those with high load was 0.97 (95%CI=0.70-1.33, p=0.877). Although the observed HR was not different from the expected one (HR=0.75, p=0.17), its approaching 1, strongly suggest that no causality underlies the association between obesity and reduced mortality risk. Conclusion: Obesity is associated with reduced mortality risk in White patients from central-southern Italy. Based upon genetic studies, this association seems not to be causal. Further studies are needed to get deeper insights on the biological link between obesity and all-cause mortality in diabetic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and related factors have been implicated as possible aetiological factors for the development of glioma in epidemiological observation studies. We used genetic markers in a Mendelian randomisation framework to examine whether obesity-related traits influence glioma risk. This methodology reduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation., METHODS: Genetic instruments were identified for 10 key obesity-related risk factors, and their association with glioma risk was evaluated using data from a genome-wide association study of 12,488 glioma patients and 18,169 controls. The estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined obesity-related traits was used to infer evidence for a causal relationship., RESULTS: No convincing association with glioma risk was seen for genetic instruments for body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, lipids, type-2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia or insulin resistance. Similarly, we found no evidence to support a relationship between obesity-related traits with subtypes of glioma-glioblastoma (GBM) or non-GBM tumours., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no evidence to implicate obesity-related factors as causes of glioma.

AB  - Accurate measurement of the marginal healthcare costs associated with different diseases and health conditions is important, especially for increasingly prevalent conditions such as obesity. However, existing observational study designs cannot identify the causal impact of disease on healthcare costs. This paper explores the possibilities for causal inference offered by Mendelian randomization, a form of instrumental variable analysis that uses genetic variation as a proxy for modifiable risk exposures, to estimate the effect of health conditions on cost. Well-conducted genome-wide association studies provide robust evidence of the associations of genetic variants with health conditions or disease risk factors. The subsequent causal effects of these health conditions on cost can be estimated using genetic variants as instruments for the health conditions. This is because the approximately random allocation of genotypes at conception means that many genetic variants are orthogonal to observable and unobservable confounders. Datasets with linked genotypic and resource use information obtained from electronic medical records or from routinely collected administrative data are now becoming available and will facilitate this form of analysis. We describe some of the methodological issues that arise in this type of analysis, which we illustrate by considering how Mendelian randomization could be used to estimate the causal impact of obesity, a complex trait, on healthcare costs. We describe some of the data sources that could be used for this type of analysis. We conclude by considering the challenges and opportunities offered by Mendelian randomization for economic evaluation.

AB  - Background High adiposity is associated with higher risks for a variety of adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of age-adjusted mortality and increased morbidity. This has important implications for the management of healthcare systems, since the endocrinal, cardiometabolic and other changes associated with increased adiposity may be associated with substantial healthcare costs. Methods We studied the association between various measures of adiposity and inpatient hospital costs through record linkage between UK Biobank and records of inpatient care in England and Wales. UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort study that aimed to recruit men and women aged between 40 and 69 from 2006 to 2010. We applied generalised linear models to cost per person year to estimate the marginal effect and averaged adjusted predicted cost of adiposity on inpatient costs. Results Valid cost and body mass index (BMI) data from 457,689 participants were available for inferential analysis. Some 54.4% of individuals included in the analysis sample had positive inpatient healthcare costs over the period of follow-up. Median hospital costs per person year of follow-up were GBP89, compared to mean costs of GBP481. Mean BMI overall was 27.4 kg/m2 (standard deviation 4.8). The marginal effect of a unit increase in BMI was GBP13.61 (99% confidence interval: GBP12.60 to GBP14.63) per person year of follow up. The marginal effect of a standard deviation increase in BMI was GBP69.20 (99% confidence interval: GBP64.98 to GBP73.42). The marginal effect of becoming obese was GBP136.35 (99% confidence interval: GBP124.62 to GBP148.08). Average adjusted predicted inpatient hospital costs increased almost linearly when modelled using continuous measure of adiposity. Sensitivity analysis of different scenarios did not substantially change these conclusions, although there was some evidence of attenuation of the effects of adiposity when controlling for waist-hip ratios, and when individuals who self-reported any pre-existing conditions were excluded from analysis. Conclusions Higher adiposity is associated with higher inpatient hospital costs. Further scrutiny using causal inferential methods is warranted to establish if further public health investments are required to manage the large healthcare costs observationally associated with overweight and obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have reported a positive association between body mass index (BMI) and ovarian cancer risk. However, questions remain as to whether this represents a causal effect, or holds for all histological subtypes. The lack of association observed for serous cancers may, for instance, be due to disease-associated weight loss. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic markers as proxies for risk factors to overcome limitations of observational studies. We used MR to elucidate the relationship between BMI and ovarian cancer, hypothesizing that genetically predicted BMI would be associated with increased risk of non-high grade serous ovarian cancers (non-HGSC) but not HGSC., METHODS: We pooled data from 39 studies (14 047 cases, 23 003 controls) in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We constructed a weighted genetic risk score (GRS, partial F-statistic = 172), summing alleles at 87 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with BMI, weighting by their published strength of association with BMI. Applying two-stage predictor-substitution MR, we used logistic regression to estimate study-specific odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between genetically predicted BMI and risk, and pooled these using random-effects meta-analysis., RESULTS: Higher genetically predicted BMI was associated with increased risk of non-HGSC (pooled OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.03-1.61 per 5 units BMI) but not HGSC (pooled OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.88-1.27). Secondary analyses stratified by behaviour/subtype suggested that, consistent with observational data, the association was strongest for low-grade/borderline serous cancers (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.33-2.81)., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that higher BMI increases risk of non-HGSC, but not the more common and aggressive HGSC subtype, confirming the observational evidence.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Observational studies have reported positive associations between higher body mass index (BMI) and risks of borderline ovarian tumors and non-high grade serous ovarian cancer (non-HGSC), but the lack of association observed for HGSC may be due to bias arising from weight loss before diagnosis. Observational studies also suggest a positive association between greater height and ovarian cancer risk, but confounding factors may be obscuring the true relationship. The Mendelian randomization (MR) technique uses genetic markers as proxies for environmental risk factors, and can overcome the limitations of bias and confounding which affect observational studies. AIM / METHODS: This study used MR to elucidate the relationship between body size (BMI and height) and risk of ovarian cancer. We pooled data from 16,395 cases and 23,003 controls, all genetically European, from 39 studies in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We constructed a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) for each trait, summing trait-increasing alleles at 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI and 609 SNPs associated with height in genome-wide association studies, weighting alleles by published beta-coefficients for their effect on the trait. Each GRS was a strong instrument for the trait (F-statistics 33.8 [BMI] and 516 [height]). In a two-stage predictor substitution MR approach, we used multivariate logistic regression to model case-control status on body size predicted by each GRS. Study-specific estimates per 5-unit increase in predicted BMI or height were pooled to generate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects meta-analysis. Our primary hypotheses were that genetic BMI would be associated with increased risk of non-HGSC but not HGSC and genetic height would be associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer overall. RESULTS: Higher genetically-predicted BMI was associated with increased risk of non-HGSC cancer (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02-1.83 per 5-unit increase) but not HGSC (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83-1.33). In secondary analyses stratified by behavior/subtype, the strongest association was seen for low grade/borderline serous cancers (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.24-3.30). Women with greater genetically-predicted height had a modestly increased risk of all (invasive and borderline) ovarian tumors (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11 per 5 cm). In secondary analyses stratified by histologic subtype, the strongest association was seen for clear cell cancers (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.38). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to apply MR to investigate ovarian cancer risk factors. These data confirm results from epidemiologic studies, suggesting that obesity is causally associated with non-HGSC, but does not increase risk of the most common HGSC subtype. They also support an association between height and ovarian cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is epidemiologically associated with hepatic and metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to examine whether hepatic fat accumulation has a causal role in determining liver damage and insulin resistance., METHODS: We performed a Mendelian randomization analysis using risk alleles in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, GCKR and MBOAT7, and a polygenic risk score for hepatic fat, as instruments. We evaluated complementary cohorts of at-risk individuals and individuals from the general population: 1515 from the liver biopsy cohort (LBC), 3329 from the Swedish Obese Subjects Study (SOS) and 4570 from the population-based Dallas Heart Study (DHS)., RESULTS: Hepatic fat was epidemiologically associated with liver damage, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. The impact of genetic variants on liver damage was proportional to their effect on hepatic fat accumulation. Genetically determined hepatic fat was associated with aminotransferases, and with inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis in the LBC. Furthermore, in the LBC, the causal association between hepatic fat and fibrosis was independent of disease activity, suggesting that a causal effect of long-term liver fat accumulation on liver disease is independent of inflammation. Genetically determined hepatic steatosis was associated with insulin resistance in the LBC and SOS. However, this association was dependent on liver damage severity. Genetically determined hepatic steatosis was associated with liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and with a small increase in risk of type 2 diabetes in publicly available databases., CONCLUSION: These data suggest that long-term hepatic fat accumulation plays a causal role in the development of chronic liver disease.

AB  - Importance: In observational studies, abdominal adiposity has been associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD). Whether these associations represent causal relationships remains uncertain., Objective: To test the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (BMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and CHD through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic phenotypes., Design, Setting, and Participants: A polygenic risk score for WHR adjusted for BMI, a measure of genetic predisposition to abdominal adiposity, was constructed with 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The association of this score with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and CHD was tested in a mendelian randomization analysis that combined case-control and cross-sectional data sets. Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on a combined data set consisting of summary results from 4 genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015, including up to 322154 participants, as well as individual-level, cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank collected from 2007-2011, including 111986 individuals. Estimates for type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from summary statistics of 2 separate genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015 and including 149821 individuals and 184305 individuals, respectively, combined with individual-level data from the UK Biobank., Exposures: Genetic predisposition to increased WHR adjusted for BMI., Main Outcomes and Measures: Type 2 diabetes and CHD., Results: Among 111986 individuals in the UK Biobank, the mean age was 57 (SD, 8) years, 58845 participants (52.5%) were women, and mean WHR was 0.875. Analysis of summary-level genome-wide association study results and individual-level UK Biobank data demonstrated that a 1-SD increase in WHR adjusted for BMI mediated by the polygenic risk score was associated with 27-mg/dL higher triglyceride levels, 4.1-mg/dL higher 2-hour glucose levels, and 2.1-mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (each P < .001). A 1-SD genetic increase in WHR adjusted for BMI was also associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.57-2.00]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 6.0 [95% CI, CI, 4.4-7.8]; number of participants with type 2 diabetes outcome, 40530) and CHD (odds ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.32-1.62]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3-2.4]; number of participants with CHD outcome, 66440)., Conclusions and Relevance: A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal adiposity and these outcomes.

AB  - Context Obesity in men is associated with low serum testosterone and both are associated with several diseases and increased mortality. Objectives Examine the direction and causality of the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and serum testosterone. Design Bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on prospective cohorts. Setting Five cohorts from Denmark, Germany and Sweden (Inter99, SHIP, SHIP Trend, GOOD and MrOS Sweden). Participants 7446 Caucasian men, genotyped for 97 BMI-associated SNPs and three testosterone-associated SNPs. Main outcome measures BMI and serum testosterone adjusted for age, smoking, time of blood sampling and site. Results 1 SD genetically instrumented increase in BMI was associated with a 0.25 SD decrease in serum testosterone (IV ratio: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.42-0.09, p = 2.8*10-3). For a body weight reduction altering the BMI from 30 to 25 kg/m2, the effect would equal a 13% increase in serum testosterone. No association was seen for genetically instrumented testosterone with BMI, a finding that was confirmed using large-scale data from the GIANT consortium (n = 104349). Conclusions Our results suggest that there is a causal effect of BMI on serum testosterone in men. Population level interventions to reduce BMI are expected to increase serum testosterone in men.Copyright © 2017 Eriksson et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between adiposity and cardiometabolic traits is well known from epidemiological studies. Whilst the causal relationship is clear for some of these traits, for others it is not. We aimed to determine whether adiposity is causally related to various cardiometabolic traits using the Mendelian randomization approach., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the adiposity-associated variant rs9939609 at the FTO locus as an instrumental variable (IV) for body mass index (BMI) in a Mendelian randomization design. Thirty-six population-based studies of individuals of European descent contributed to the analyses. Age- and sex-adjusted regression models were fitted to test for association between (i) rs9939609 and BMI (n = 198,502), (ii) rs9939609 and 24 traits, and (iii) BMI and 24 traits. The causal effect of BMI on the outcome measures was quantified by IV estimators. The estimators were compared to the BMI-trait associations derived from the same individuals. In the IV analysis, we demonstrated novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and incident heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.19 per BMI-unit increase; 95% CI, 1.03-1.39) and replicated earlier reports of a causal association with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (odds ratio for IV estimator, 1.1-1.4; all p < 0.05). For quantitative traits, our results provide novel evidence for a causal effect of adiposity on the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and confirm previous reports of a causal effect of adiposity on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, 2-h post-load glucose from the oral glucose tolerance test, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (all p < 0.05). The estimated causal effects were in agreement with traditional observational measures in all instances except for type 2 diabetes, where the causal estimate was larger than the observational estimate (p = 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and heart failure as well as between adiposity and increased liver enzymes.

AB  - Observational studies have reported different effects of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors across age and sex. Since cardiovascular risk factors are enriched in obese individuals, it has not been easy to dissect the effects of adiposity from those of other risk factors. We used a Mendelian randomization approach, applying a set of 32 genetic markers to estimate the causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, glycemic indices, circulating lipid levels, and markers of inflammation and liver disease in up to 67,553 individuals. All analyses were stratified by age (cutoff 55 years of age) and sex. The genetic score was associated with BMI in both nonstratified analysis (P = 2.8 x 10(-107)) and stratified analyses (all P < 3.3 x 10(-30)). We found evidence of a causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, fasting levels of insulin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in a nonstratified analysis and in the <55-year stratum. Further, we found evidence of a smaller causal effect on total cholesterol (P for difference = 0.015) in the >=55-year stratum than in the <55-year stratum, a finding that could be explained by biology, survival bias, or differential medication. In conclusion, this study extends previous knowledge of the effects of adiposity by providing sex- and age-specific causal estimates on cardiovascular risk factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the causal effect of time-varying z-BMI growth on early menarche using Mendelian randomisation (MR); to identify critical adiposity predictors of early menarche; to compare the effects of birthweight and time-varying z-BMI growth as mediators of the path from genes to early menarche using mediation analysis., METHODS: We used data from the Taiwan Children Health Study with 21 obesity-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to yield genetic (instrumental variable)IVs for adiposity. Children with available data on genotyping, birthweight, adiposity, and menarcheal age were included., RESULTS: In MR analyses, results based on the time-varying z-BMI growth show more statistical power and capture more information of adiposity growth (p=0.01) than those based on single point z-BMI (p=0.02). Among adiposity measures, critical predictors of early menarche are fat free mass (RR=1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.65) and waist/height ratio (RR=1.27, 95% CI 1.03-1.56). Other potential predictors of early menarche are sum of skinfold (RR=1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.48) and total body fat (RR=1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.38). In both one-mediation and multi-mediation analyses, time-varying z-BMI growth in the prepubertal years plays a crucial mediator in the pathway from the genes to early menarche., CONCLUSIONS: This study discovered that greater prepubertal adiposity growth is a crucial mediator in the path from genes to early menarche. For girls with genes positively associated with obesity; and/or of lower birthweight, a strategy to prevent childhood adiposity should be implemented in order to avoid early menarche development.

AB  - Mendelian Randomisation (MR) uses single nucleotide variants as 'naturally-randomised' instrumental variables to assess a causal link between a risk-factor and an outcome (e.g. disease). MR has thrived over recent years with the expanding success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The wide-spread availability of summary association statistics from hundreds of GWAS, which have identified ~32,000 trait associated loci, have allowed for MR analyses which aggregate effect estimates across hundreds of instruments and multiple risk-factors. However, a key assumption of MR is the exclusion restriction: a genetic instrument only acts on the outcome through the risk-factor. Violations of this, when a locus is associated with multiple traits (pleiotropy), is com-mon in human genetics; leading to bias of causal effect estimates and effect heterogeneity in aggregated analyses. We focus on the assessment of composite risk-factors (CRFs), i.e. risk-factors that are composed of several lower-level risk-factors (LLRFs), e.g. BMI is a CRF computed from two LLRFs: body weight and height. If a LLRF is associated with the outcome directly as well as being mediated through the CRF, the MR estimates suffer symptoms of pleiotropy. We take advantage of this detail, however, and by blending a Bayesian Model Averaging technique with a novel feature selection algorithm we: 1) identify the number of latent LLRFs 2) match each instrument to a LLRF group and either 3a) estimate a CRF causal effect or 3b) interpret results when all instruments are invalid. We illustrate this hypothesis-free approach using BMI and inflammation CRF examples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Varicose veins are a common problem with no approved medical therapies. Although it is believed that varicose vein pathogenesis is multifactorial, there is limited understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to their formation. Large-scale studies of risk factors for varicose veins may highlight important aspects of pathophysiology and identify groups at increased risk for disease., METHODS: We applied machine learning to agnostically search for risk factors of varicose veins in 493 519 individuals in the UK Biobank. Predictors were further studied with univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses (2441 incident events). A genome-wide association study of varicose veins was also performed among 337 536 unrelated individuals (9577 cases) of white British descent, followed by expression quantitative loci and pathway analyses. Because height emerged as a new candidate risk factor, we performed mendelian randomization analyses to assess a potential causal role for height in varicose vein development., RESULTS: Machine learning confirmed several known (age, sex, obesity, pregnancy, history of deep vein thrombosis) and identified several new risk factors for varicose vein disease, including height. After adjustment for traditional risk factors in Cox regression, greater height remained independently associated with varicose veins (hazard ratio for upper versus lower quartile, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.51-2.01; P<0.0001). A genome-wide association study identified 30 new genome-wide significant loci, identifying pathways involved in vascular development and skeletal/limb biology. Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence that increased height is causally related to varicose veins (inverse-variance weighted: odds ratio, 1.26; P=2.07x10-16)., CONCLUSIONS: Using data from nearly a half-million individuals, we present a comprehensive genetic and epidemiological study of varicose veins. We identified novel clinical and genetic risk factors that provide pathophysiological insights and could help future improvements of treatment of varicose vein disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiposity traits have been associated with risk of many cancers in observational studies, but whether these associations are causal is unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic predictors of risk factors as instrumental variables to eliminate reverse causation and reduce confounding bias. We performed MR analyses to assess the possible causal relationship of birthweight, childhood and adult body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) on the risks of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers., METHODS: We tested the association between genetic risk scores and each trait using summary statistics from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and from 51 537 cancer cases and 61 600 controls in the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) Consortium., RESULTS: We found an inverse association between the genetic score for childhood BMI and risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71 per standard deviation (s.d.) increase in childhood BMI; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 0.80; P = 6.5 x 10(-5)). We also found the genetic score for adult BMI to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk (OR = 0.66 per s.d. increase in BMI; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.77; P = 2.5 x 10(-7)), and positively associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.72; P = 0.017), lung cancer (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.49; P = 2.9 x 10(-3)) and colorectal cancer (OR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.82, P = 0.016). The inverse association between genetically predicted adult BMI and breast cancer risk remained even after adjusting for directional pleiotropy via MR-Egger regression., CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study provide additional understandings of the complex relationship between adiposity and cancer risks. Our results for breast and lung cancer are particularly interesting, given previous reports of effect heterogeneity by menopausal status and smoking status.

AB  - Objective: To explore the association between DNA methylation and body mass index (BMI) using Mendelian randomization analysis. Methods: A total of 469 participants were selected from the Chinese National Twin Registry in 2013, who were living in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces, and at least 18 years of age. A questionnaire survey and physical examination were conducted to collect demographic, clinical, and behavioral information. Peripheral blood cells were collected to detect genotype and methylation status. Association analyses between DNA methylation and BMI and between CpGs and cis-SNP were conducted. With rs748212 as the instrumental variable, the association between cg15053022 and BMI was explored using the Mendelian randomization method. Results: A total of 469 participants were selected. The mean age of participants was (44.8+/-13.2) years and the BMI was (25.0+/-3.8) kg/m(2). Nine BMI-related DNA methylation sites were found and DNA methylation site cg15053022 in the ATP4A gene was negatively associated with cis-SNP rs748212 (beta=-0.020); the mean methylation level of AA, AC, and CC were 0.212+/-0.025, 0.242+/-0.024, and 0.264+/-0.028, respectively. rs748212 was associated with BMI (beta=0.04, P=0.007) and closely related to cg15053022 (F=237.66, P=0.143). Mendelian randomization analysis showed lower methylation levels at cg15053022 were associated with higher BMI (beta=-1.97, P<0.001). Conclusion: This study supported the impact of cg15053022 methylation in the ATP4A gene on BMI using Mendelian randomization analysis and provided the basis for using Mendelian randomization analysis in methylation studies.

AB  - Observational studies find an association between body mass index (BMI) and self-reported sleep duration in adults such that a higher BMI is associated with shorter duration of sleep. However, the key question here is whether this relationship is causal, in either direction. Recently, findings from a Mendelian randomisation study in the UK Biobank suggest that a higher BMI does not in fact cause short sleep duration. Thus, it is likely that there are alternative biological pathways through which BMI and sleep duration are associated, but this has not been examined in depth, to date. To investigate this further we created several polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of BMI and examined their association with self-reported sleep duration in a combination of individual participant data (IPD) and summary-level data, with a total sample size of*140,000. We find that, although a PRS of BMI is negatively associated with sleep duration, this explains a very small proportion of its variance. We will present detailed findings alongside a discussion of these, with reference to previous research and potential for future work.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the causal effect of childhood BMI on adult cardiometabolic diseases using a Mendelian randomization analysis., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables for childhood BMI to test the causal effect of childhood BMI on cardiometabolic diseases using summary-level data from consortia., RESULTS: We found that a 1-SD increase in childhood BMI (kg/m2) was associated with an 83% increase in risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.83 [95% CI 1.46, 2.30]; P = 2.5 x 10-7) and a 28% increase in risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.17, 1.39]; P = 2.1 x 10-8) at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance (P < 0.017) in adults. In addition, a 1-SD increase in childhood BMI was associated with a 0.587-SD increase in adulthood BMI (kg/m2), a 0.062-SD increase in hip circumference (cm), a 0.602-SD increase in waist circumference (cm), a 0.111 pmol/L increase in log fasting insulin, a 0.068 increase in log-transformed HOMA of s-cell function (%), a 0.126 increase in log-transformed HOMA of insulin resistance (%), and a 0.109-SD increase in triglyceride (mg/dL) but a 0.138-SD decrease in HDL (mg/dL) in adults at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance (P < 0.0026)., CONCLUSIONS: A genetic predisposition to higher childhood BMI was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and CAD in adult life. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between childhood BMI and these outcomes. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have illustrated that maternal central obesity is associated with birth size, including of birth weight, birth length and head circumference, but the causal nature of these associations remains unclear. Our study aimed to test the causal effect of maternal central obesity on birth size and puberty height growth using a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis., METHODS: We performed two-sample MR using summary-level genome-wide public data. Thirty-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 25 SNPs and 41 SNPs were selected as instrumental variables for waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, waist circumference adjusted for BMI and hip circumference adjusted for BMI, respectively to test the causal effects of maternal central obesity on birth size and puberty height using an inverse-variance-weighted approach., RESULTS: In this MR analysis, we found no evidence of a causal association between waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio and the outcomes. However, we observed that one standard deviation (SD) increase in hip circumference (HIP) was associated with a 0.392 SD increase in birth length (p = 1.1 x 10- 6) and a 0.168 SD increase in birth weight (p = 7.1 x 10- 5), respectively at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance. In addition, higher genetically predicted maternal HIP was strongly associated with the puberty heights (0.835 SD, p = 8.4 x 10- 10). However, HIP was not associated with head circumference (p = 0.172)., CONCLUSIONS: A genetic predisposition to higher maternal HIP was causally associated with larger offspring birth size independent of maternal BMI. However, we found no evidence of a causal association between maternal waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and birth size.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether body mass index (BMI) is causally associated with the risk of being diagnosed with or dying from any cancer remains unclear. Weight reduction has clinical importance for cancer control only if weight gain causes cancer development or death. We aimed to answer the question 'does genetically predicted BMI influence my risk of being diagnosed with or dying from any cancer'., METHODS: We used a Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach to estimate causal effect of BMI in 46,155 white-British participants aged between 40 and 69 years at recruitment (median age at follow-up 61 years) from the UK Biobank, who developed any type of cancer, among whom 6998 died from cancer. To derive MR instruments for BMI, we selected up to 390,628 cancer-free participants., RESULTS: For each standard deviation (4.78 units) increase in genetically predicted BMI, we estimated a causal odds ratio (COR) of 1.07 (1.02-1.12) and 1.28 (1.16-1.41) for overall cancer risk and mortality, respectively. The corresponding estimates were similar for males and females, and smokers and non-smokers., CONCLUSIONS: Higher genetically predicted BMI increases the risk of being diagnosed with or dying from any cancer. These data suggest that increased overall weight may causally increase overall cancer incidence and mortality among Europeans.

AB  - Objective: We utilized Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal relationship between increasing body mass index (BMI) and pediatric MS susceptibility using a weighted BMI genetic risk score (BMI GRS). Background: Childhood and adolescent obesity are associated with a two-fold increased risk of pediatric and adult-onset MS. However, the relationship between obesity and MS may be confounded by lifestyle and/or socioeconomic factors that have not been appropriately adjusted for in previous studies. Methods: The BMI GRS incorporates the cumulative effect of 97 variants associated with BMI identified from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS), to date (Locke et al, 2015). A split-sample instrumental variable (IV) analysis was used by summing all risk alleles multiplied by the estimated effect of each risk allele on the phenotype derived from the GWAS. Participants included non-Hispanic white pediatric MS cases and controls from over 15 sites across the U.S. (total sample size: 394 MS cases, 10,875 controls). Results: A significant association between BMI GRS and pediatric MS was demonstrated (causal odds ratio [OR] = 1.20, 95[percnt] CI 1.06, 1.36; p=0.004) after adjusting for sex, ancestry, HLA-DRB1* 15:01 (the strongest genetic predictor of MS) and a weighted genetic risk score comprised of 110 non-HLA MS risk variants. Evidence of interaction between BMI GRS and HLA-DRB1* 15:01 was also present (p-interaction= 0.04); individuals carrying 1-2 DRB1* 15:01 risk alleles demonstrated a stronger association (OR=1.39, 95[percnt] CI 1.16, 1.37) compared to non-carriers (OR=1.05, 95[percnt] CI 0.88, 1.26). Conclusions: For the first time, we provide evidence supporting increased BMI is causally associated with pediatric MS and interacts with HLA-DRB1* 15:01 status. Further, pediatric MS risk conferred by obesity may involve predisposing genetic factors for increased BMI, suggesting that specific inflammatory mechanisms involved in the obesity pathway may mediate disease onset.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Recent studies indicate that childhood and adolescent obesity double the risk of MS, but this association may reflect unmeasured confounders rather than causal effects of obesity. We used separate-sample Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on susceptibility to MS. Using data from non-Hispanic white members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan of Northern California (KPNC) (2006-2014; 1,104 cases of MS and 10,536 controls) and a replication data set from Sweden (the Epidemiological Investigation of MS (EIMS) and the Genes and Environment in MS (GEMS) studies, 2005-2013; 5,133 MS cases and 4,718 controls), we constructed a weighted genetic risk score using 97 variants previously established to predict BMI. Results were adjusted for birth year, sex, education, smoking status, ancestry, and genetic predictors of MS. Estimates in KPNC and Swedish data sets suggested that higher genetically induced BMI predicted greater susceptibility to MS (odds ratio = 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.22 for the KPNC sample; odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.15 for the Swedish sample). Although the mechanism remains unclear, to our knowledge, these findings support a causal effect of increased BMI on susceptibility to MS for the first time, and they suggest a role for inflammatory pathways that characterize both obesity and the MS disease process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To utilize Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal association between low serum vitamin D concentrations, increased body mass index (BMI), and pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) using genetic risk scores (GRS)., METHODS: We constructed an instrumental variable for vitamin D (vitD GRS) by computing a GRS for 3 genetic variants associated with levels of 25(OH)D in serum using the estimated effect of each risk variant. A BMI GRS was also created that incorporates the cumulative effect of 97 variants associated with BMI. Participants included non-Hispanic white individuals recruited from over 15 sites across the United States (n = 394 cases, 10,875 controls) and Sweden (n = 175 cases, 5,376 controls; total n = 16,820)., RESULTS: Meta-analysis findings demonstrated that a vitD GRS associated with increasing levels of 25(OH)D in serum decreased the odds of pediatric-onset MS (odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55, 0.94; p = 0.02) after controlling for sex, genetic ancestry, HLA-DRB1*15:01, and over 100 non-human leukocyte antigen MS risk variants. A significant association between BMI GRS and pediatric disease onset was also demonstrated (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05, 1.30; p = 0.01) after adjusting for covariates. Estimates for each GRS were unchanged when considered together in a multivariable model., CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence supporting independent and causal effects of decreased vitamin D levels and increased BMI on susceptibility to pediatric-onset MS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have reported associations between body mass index (BMI) and asthma, but confounding and reverse causality remain plausible explanations. We aim to investigate evidence for a causal effect of BMI on asthma using a Mendelian randomization approach., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used Mendelian randomization to investigate causal effects of BMI, fat mass, and lean mass on current asthma at age 71/2 y in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). A weighted allele score based on 32 independent BMI-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was derived from external data, and associations with BMI, fat mass, lean mass, and asthma were estimated. We derived instrumental variable (IV) estimates of causal risk ratios (RRs). 4,835 children had available data on BMI-associated SNPs, asthma, and BMI. The weighted allele score was strongly associated with BMI, fat mass, and lean mass (all p-values<0.001) and with childhood asthma (RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.38-4.76 per unit score, p = 0.003). The estimated causal RR for the effect of BMI on asthma was 1.55 (95% CI 1.16-2.07) per kg/m2, p = 0.003. This effect appeared stronger for non-atopic (1.90, 95% CI 1.19-3.03) than for atopic asthma (1.37, 95% CI 0.89-2.11) though there was little evidence of heterogeneity (p = 0.31). The estimated causal RRs for the effects of fat mass and lean mass on asthma were 1.41 (95% CI 1.11-1.79) per 0.5 kg and 2.25 (95% CI 1.23-4.11) per kg, respectively. The possibility of genetic pleiotropy could not be discounted completely; however, additional IV analyses using FTO variant rs1558902 and the other BMI-related SNPs separately provided similar causal effects with wider confidence intervals. Loss of follow-up was unlikely to bias the estimated effects., CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI increases the risk of asthma in mid-childhood. Higher BMI may have contributed to the increase in asthma risk toward the end of the 20th century. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.

AB  - Studies have reported associations between body mass index (BMI) and asthma in childhood, but it is difficult to exclude confounding and reverse causality as explanations. Genomewide association studies have identified 32 independent loci associated with BMI (Speliotes EK et al. 2010). We used Mendelian randomization to investigate the causal effect of BMI, fat mass and lean mass on childhood asthma. A weighted allele score was derived from 32 imputed SNPs. We multiplied the imputation weight of the risk allele by a SNP-specific weight as estimated in the reported meta-analysis by Speliotes et al., then averaged across SNPs. We estimated associations of the weighted allele score with BMI, fat mass, lean mass and asthma at age 7-7.5. The generalized method of moments was used to estimate causal (instrumental variable) risk ratios for the effect of BMI, fat and lean mass on asthma (Palmer TM et al. 2011). 4835 children had complete data on 32 BMI-associated SNPs, asthma and BMI at 7-7.5 years. The weighted allele score was strongly associated with BMI (regression coefficient 2.22, 95% CI 1.76-2.67, p=2.3x10-21), fat mass (2.88, 2.35-3.42, p=2.0x10-25), lean mass (1.22, 0.80-1.64, p=1.6x10-8) and childhood asthma (risk ratio [RR] 2.56, 1.38-4.76, p=0.003). The estimated causal RR for the effect of BMI on asthma was 1.55 (1.16-2.07), p=0.003. This effect appeared stronger in girls (1.77, 1.13-2.77, p=0.01) than boys (1.40, 0.96-2.04, p=0.08). The estimated causal RRs for the effect of fat mass and lean mass on asthma were 1.41 (1.11-1.79), p=0.01 and 2.25 (1.23-4.11), p=0.01 respectively. Higher BMI, fat mass and lean mass in mid childhood cause increases in the risk of childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with reduced survival for women with breast cancer. However, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate a possible causal role of BMI in survival from breast cancer., Methods: We used individual-level data from six large breast cancer case-cohorts including a total of 36 210 individuals (2475 events) of European ancestry. We created a BMI genetic risk score (GRS) based on genotypes at 94 known BMI-associated genetic variants. Association between the BMI genetic score and breast cancer survival was analysed by Cox regression for each study separately. Study-specific hazard ratios were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis., Results: BMI genetic score was found to be associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cases [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.11, per one-unit increment of GRS, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.22, P = 0.03). We observed no association for ER-negative cases (HR = 1.00, per one-unit increment of GRS, 95% CI 0.89-1.13, P = 0.95)., Conclusions: Our findings suggest a causal effect of increased BMI on reduced breast cancer survival for ER-positive breast cancer. There is no evidence of a causal effect of higher BMI on survival for ER-negative breast cancer cases. Copyright © The Author 2017.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational epidemiological studies have shown that high body mass index (BMI) is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women but an increased risk in postmenopausal women. It is unclear whether this association is mediated through shared genetic or environmental factors., METHODS: We applied Mendelian randomization to evaluate the association between BMI and risk of breast cancer occurrence using data from two large breast cancer consortia. We created a weighted BMI genetic score comprising 84 BMI-associated genetic variants to predicted BMI. We evaluated genetically predicted BMI in association with breast cancer risk using individual-level data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) (cases = 46,325, controls = 42,482). We further evaluated the association between genetically predicted BMI and breast cancer risk using summary statistics from 16,003 cases and 41,335 controls from the Discovery, Biology, and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer (DRIVE) Project. Because most studies measured BMI after cancer diagnosis, we could not conduct a parallel analysis to adequately evaluate the association of measured BMI with breast cancer risk prospectively., RESULTS: In the BCAC data, genetically predicted BMI was found to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.65 per 5 kg/m2 increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.75, p = 3.32 x 10-10). The associations were similar for both premenopausal (OR = 0.44, 95% CI:0.31-0.62, p = 9.91 x 10-8) and postmenopausal breast cancer (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.46-0.71, p = 1.88 x 10-8). This association was replicated in the data from the DRIVE consortium (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.84, p = 1.64 x 10-7). Single marker analyses identified 17 of the 84 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in association with breast cancer risk at p < 0.05; for 16 of them, the allele associated with elevated BMI was associated with reduced breast cancer risk., CONCLUSIONS: BMI predicted by genome-wide association studies (GWAS)-identified variants is inversely associated with the risk of both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer. The reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer associated with genetically predicted BMI observed in this study differs from the positive association reported from studies using measured adult BMI. Understanding the reasons for this discrepancy may reveal insights into the complex relationship of genetic determinants of body weight in the etiology of breast cancer.

AB  - Causes of the association between cognitive ability and health remain unknown, but may reflect a shared genetic aetiology. This study examines the causal genetic associations between cognitive ability and physical health. We carried out two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses using the inverse-variance weighted method to test for causality between later life cognitive ability, educational attainment (as a proxy for cognitive ability in youth), BMI, height, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes using data from six independent GWAS consortia and the UK Biobank sample (N = 112 151). BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes showed negative associations with cognitive ability; height was positively associated with cognitive ability. The analyses provided no evidence for casual associations from health to cognitive ability. In the other direction, higher educational attainment predicted lower BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and taller stature. The analyses indicated no causal association from educational attainment to physical health. The lack of evidence for causal associations between cognitive ability, educational attainment, and physical health could be explained by weak instrumental variables, poorly measured outcomes, or the small number of disease cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiposity, as indicated by body mass index (BMI), has been associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases in epidemiological studies. We aimed to investigate if these associations are causal, using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods., METHODS: The associations of BMI with cardiovascular outcomes [coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure and ischaemic stroke], and associations of a genetic score (32 BMI single nucleotide polymorphisms) with BMI and cardiovascular outcomes were examined in up to 22,193 individuals with 3062 incident cardiovascular events from nine prospective follow-up studies within the ENGAGE consortium. We used random-effects meta-analysis in an MR framework to provide causal estimates of the effect of adiposity on cardiovascular outcomes., RESULTS: There was a strong association between BMI and incident CHD (HR = 1.20 per SD-increase of BMI, 95% CI, 1.12-1.28, P = 1.9.10(-7)), heart failure (HR = 1.47, 95% CI, 1.35-1.60, P = 9.10(-19)) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.15, 95% CI, 1.06-1.24, P = 0.0008) in observational analyses. The genetic score was robustly associated with BMI (beta = 0.030 SD-increase of BMI per additional allele, 95% CI, 0.028-0.033, P = 3.10(-107)). Analyses indicated a causal effect of adiposity on development of heart failure (HR = 1.93 per SD-increase of BMI, 95% CI, 1.12-3.30, P = 0.017) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.83, 95% CI, 1.05-3.20, P = 0.034). Additional cross-sectional analyses using both ENGAGE and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D data showed a causal effect of adiposity on CHD., CONCLUSIONS: Using MR methods, we provide support for the hypothesis that adiposity causes CHD, heart failure and, previously not demonstrated, ischaemic stroke.

AB  - Objective: To investigate through Mendelian randomization (MR) the direct causal effect of obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI) on MS susceptibility independent of variations in vitamin D levels. Background: Several lines of evidence support a causal role for obesity in the development of MS. However, the exact biological pathways underlying this association remain unclear. Vitamin D has been proposed as a possible mediator since increased adiposity leads to lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which in turn predispose to MS. However, the importance of this pathway in adult-onset MS remains unclear. Design/Methods: We selected genetic variants strongly associated with BMI in the genome wide association study (GWAS) by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium, which includes 322, 105 individuals. Corresponding effect estimates for these variants on MS susceptibility were obtained from the latest International MS Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) meta-analysis (14, 802 cases, 26, 703 controls). We evaluated the association between obesity and risk of MS using conventional MR methods. Next, we included genetic data from a vitamin D study of 42, 274 individuals in a multivariable MR analysis to obtain the direct effect of BMI on MS adjusting for vitamin D levels. Results: We identified 76 independent genome-wide significant BMI-related variants in GIANT. We confirmed the association between genetically determined BMI and MS susceptibility, with a standard deviation increase in BMI raising odds of MS by 34% (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.64, p=0.003). This association remained largely unchanged after adjusting for vitamin D levels in the multivariable MR, with a standard deviation in BMI remaining associated with a 33% increase in odds of MS (OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.09-1.63, p=0.005). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the effect of obesity on MS risk is not mediated only by lowered vitamin D levels. These findings provide motivation to better understand how obesity increases the risk of MS.

AB  - Obesity is a highly prevalent risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases. Observational studies suggest that obesity is associated with psychiatric traits, but causal inference from such studies has several limitations. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization methods (inverse variance weighting, weighted median and MR-Egger regression) to evaluate the association of body mass index (BMI) with three psychiatric traits using data from the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits and Psychiatric Genomics consortia. Causal odds ratio estimates per 1-standard deviation increment in BMI ranged from 0.88 (95% CI: 0.62; 1.25) to 1.23 (95% CI: 0.65; 2.31) for bipolar disorder; 0.93 (0.78; 1.11) to 1.41 (0.87; 2.27) for schizophrenia; and 1.15 (95% CI: 0.92; 1.44) to 1.40 (95% CI: 1.03; 1.90) for major depressive disorder. Analyses removing potentially influential SNPs suggested that the effect estimates for depression might be underestimated. Our findings do not support the notion that higher BMI increases risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Although the point estimates for depression were consistent in all sensitivity analyses, the overall statistical evidence was weak. However, the fact that SNP-depression associations were estimated in relatively small samples reduced power to detect causal effects. This should be re-addressed when SNP-depression associations from larger studies become available.

AB  - Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common complex disease with huge public health burden. Established clinical risk factors for OA include increasing age, female sex, obesity, occupational exposure to high levels of joint loading activity, previous injury, smoking status and family history of OA. Methods:We performed a genome-wide association study for OA using data across 16.5 million variants from the UK Biobank resource. We used LDhub to estimate the genome-wide genetic correlation between OA and 219 other traits and diseases. We undertook Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses to strengthen causal inference regarding modifiable exposures that could influence OA risk. MR uses genetic variants robustly associated with a given disease risk factor or exposure phenotype of interest as instrumental variables, in order to estimate the causal effect of such exposure phenotype on disease risk. Genetic instruments were identified from publicly-available summary GWAS results through the TwoSampleMR R package, which allows extracting the data available in the MR-Base database. For each trait, all genetic instruments achieved the conventional levels of genome-wide significance (i.e., P<5.0x10-8) and were mutually independent (i.e. r2<0.001 between all pairs of instruments). Results: We identified 35 phenotypes with significant (5% FDR) genetic correlation with OA. The phenotypes with significant genetic correlations (rg) fall into the following broad categories: obesity, BMI and related anthropometric traits (rg>0); type 2 diabetes (rg>0); educational achievement (rg<0); neuroticism, depressive symptoms (rg>0), and sleep duration (rg<0); mother's, father's, or parents' age at death (rg<0); reproductive phenotypes, including age at first birth (rg<0) and number of children ever born (rg>0); smoking, including age of smoking initiation (rg<0) and ever smoker (rg>0), and lung cancer (rg>0). Each kg/m2 increment in body mass index was predicted to increase risk of self-reported OA by 1.11 (95% CI: 1.07-1.15, P = 8.3x10-7). This result was consistent across MR methods (OR ranging from 1.52 to 1.66) and disease definition (OR ranging from 1.66 to 2.01). Consistent results were also observed for other obesity-related measures, such as waist (OR: 1.03 per cm increment; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05, P = 5x10-4) and hip circumference (OR: 1.03 per cm increment; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06, P = 0.021). OR for type 2 diabetes liability and triglycerides were consistently small in magnitude across estimators and OA definitions. For lumbar spine bone mineral density, there was evidence of a causal effect with OR per standard deviation increment of 1.28 (95% CI: 1.11-1.47, P = 0.002) for hip and/or knee OA. This effect appeared to be site-specific, with OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.06-1.57, P = 0.014) for knee OA, while OR for hip OA ranged from 0.71 to 1.57. There was also some evidence for a site-specific causal effect of height on knee OA (OR: 1.13 per standard deviation increment; 95% CI: 1.02-1.25, P = 0.023). Onesample MR analyses corroborated these findings, with obesity-related phenotypes presenting strong statistical evidence after multiple testing correction. Conclusions: Mendelian randomization provided insight into the nature of the genetic correlations we observed. In the case of BMI and other obesity-related measures, therewas evidence for a causal effect of those phenotypes on OA. This result corroborates the findings from conventional observational studies. For all other exposure phenotypes, there was no convincing evidence for a causal effect on OA risk, suggesting that the genetic correlations detected by LD score regression may be mostly due to horizontal pleiotropy, although for some phenotypes the MR analyses were underpowered. In the case of triglycerides and liability to type 2 diabetes, the MR analyses had sufficient power to rule out non-small causal effects, suggesting that these phenotypes have at most weak effects on OA risk.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Elucidating the causal effects of common intermediate risk factors on the onset of age-related diseases is indispensable for developing prevention and intervention procedures., METHODS: We conducted two-stage time-to-event Mendelian randomization meta-analyses combining five large-scale longitudinal cohorts to investigate dynamic causal effects of cardiovascular disease risk factors including body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and lipids on the age-at-onset of age-related diseases. We constructed weighted polygenic scores based on genetic markers from previously reported genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects. To avoid false positive due to potential pleiotropic effects of the genetic markers, we performed a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and an MR-Egger sensitivity analysis that we expanded in the survival context., RESULTS: Our results show that elevated BMI increases the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (p=7.68e-04), heart failure (p=9.03e-03), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (p=1.69e-03) and the causal effects start at different ages. A significant association between BMI and the risk of stroke is observed; however, the sensitivity analyses suggest that the association is attributed to the potential pleiotropic effects of rs2867125 and rs1558902. Raised SBP levels are significantly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation (p=6.42e-03). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are inversely associated with the age-at-onset of T2D (p=1.05e-02). In addition, LDL-C and triglycerides are inversely associated with the risks of cancer and T2D, respectively. Nevertheless, the sensitivity analyses suggest that these associations are probably due to pleiotropic effects of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms including rs4970834 and rs1260326., CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the involvement of BMI in the development of multiple age-related diseases. Some observed causal associations can attribute to pleiotropic effects of some genetic variations. These findings have important implications in unraveling causal effects of common risk factors on age-related diseases and guiding effective intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of these diseases.

AB  - A major application for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been the emerging field of causal inference using Mendelian randomization (MR), where the causal effect between a pair of traits can be estimated using only summary level data. MR depends on SNPs exhibiting vertical pleiotropy, where the SNP influences an outcome phenotype only through an exposure phenotype. Issues arise when this assumption is violated due to SNPs exhibiting horizontal pleiotropy. We demonstrate that across a range of pleiotropy models, instrument selection will be increasingly liable to selecting invalid instruments as GWAS sample sizes continue to grow. Methods have been developed in an attempt to protect MR from different patterns of horizontal pleiotropy, and here we have designed a mixture-of-experts machine learning framework (MR-MoE 1.0) that predicts the most appropriate model to use for any specific causal analysis, improving on both power and false discovery rates. Using the approach, we systematically estimated the causal effects amongst 2407 phenotypes. Almost 90% of causal estimates indicated some level of horizontal pleiotropy. The causal estimates are organised into a publicly available graph database (http://eve.mrbase.org), and we use it here to highlight the numerous challenges that remain in automated causal inference.

AB  - Published genetic associations can be used to infer causal relationships between phenotypes, bypassing the need for individual-level genotype or phenotype data. We have curated complete summary data from 1094 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on diseases and other complex traits into a centralised database, and developed an analytical platform that uses these data to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) tests and sensitivity analyses (MR-Base, http://www.mrbase.org). Combined with curated data of published GWAS hits for phenomic measures, the MR-Base platform enables millions of potential causal relationships to be evaluated. We use the platform to predict the impact of lipid lowering on human health. While our analysis provides evidence that reducing LDL-cholesterol, lipoprotein(a) or triglyceride levels reduce coronary disease risk, it also suggests causal effects on a number of other non-vascular outcomes, indicating potential for adverse-effects or drug repositioning of lipid-lowering therapies.

AB  - Asthma and obesity have both increased in prevalence in comparable settings and over a similar period of time. It is tempting to speculate that there must be a direct link between the two. However, the association between two phenomena in no way implies that they are in any way related, far less that one causes the other. However, there have been a number of cross sectional and longitudinal studies that have established a positive association between asthma/wheezing and high body mass (usually expressed as body mass index (BMI kg/m2) either as a continuum or more usually using accepted categorical thresholds of overweight and obesity). There are several possible explanations for such an association; they include reverse causation of respiratory symptoms by overweight, confounding by one or more independent variables, including shared genetic factors, associated with both high body mass and wheezing illness, mechanical effects of body fat distribution on respiratory function, and the play of chance. Infant growth could play into this relationship either through direct links between early body size and growth and later obesity1 or through other mechanisms, such as the association between rapid growth in early childhood and lung function development. This raises a further question about the significance of rapid early growth; it could be a marker of intrauterine adversity even if birth weight is nominally in the normal range, i.e. not all growth retarded infants will have a birth weight <2500g, or it could be a feature of variations in infant nutritional practices. Obesity and Asthma: The Observational Evidence Cross sectional studies: The majority of cross sectional studies of obesity and asthma have reported a positive association overall with a suggestion that obese girls have a stronger association with asthma than their male counterparts. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the sex-stratified risks between individual studies and a systematic review of sex modification of the association between obesity and incident asthma in children reported a stronger effect in boys than girls. Recent cross sectional evidence suggested that fat distribution played a role in the association, with central obesity being associated with asthma. It has also been reported that the association with obesity is stronger for nonallergic compared with allergic asthma. However, there is also a suggested link between high body mass in children and atopic sensitization. Therefore, although the cross sectional evidence supports an association, its potential mechanism is highly uncertain. Longitudinal studies: Six longitudinal studies in children <18 years old met inclusion criteria in a recent systematic review2 of the prospective association between obesity and asthma diagnosis, with at least 1 year between measurement of BMI and diagnosis of asthma. Obesity/ overweight was variously considered as BMI >85th centile for sex and age or BMI z-score. The majority described positive associations with some discordance in sex-stratified risk between individual studies. The combined effect estimates showed positive associations for both overweight (>85th centile BMI) and obesity (>95th centile BMI) with asthma. These results were consistent with earlier findings in adult men and women3. Early Childhood Growth, Obesity and Asthma We analyzed detailed growth data of over 9,000 children from birth to 10 years using linear splines to look at different parts of the growth trajectory. We found that rapid weight gain from birth to 3 months was associated with later asthma diagnosis and bronchial hyper-responsiveness4. The impact of early postnatal growth on asthma could be mediated through a causal association between obesity and asthma in later childhood. Both infant size and rate of weight gain during infancy have been associated with obesity at later ages1. Infant obesity, measured by a variety of different metrics, including BMI >90th centile, in cohort and case-control studies showed consistent associations with obesity outcomes at a range of ag s across the lifecourse from preschool to late adulthood. Also, the majority of studies of rapid weight gain in infancy measured over different periods showed positive associations with later childhood and adolescent obesity. Another possible explanation is the reported link between rapid postnatal growth and lower lung function in infancy and beyond. Small airways could predispose to wheezing symptoms that are misclassified as asthma in young children. Alternatively, rapid weight gain or feeding practices in infancy may have direct effects on immune development. Causal Methods to Evaluate the Link Between Obesity and Asthma in Children One of the major problems with making causal inferences from observational associations is that of confounding by both measured and unmeasured variables. We used a Mendelian randomization approach to test the unconfounded association between body mass and asthma in a birth cohort of children. Genetic risk for obesity was generated using a risk score based on 32 risk alleles, including FTO. On the assumption that these alleles are randomly assorted at meiosis, they can be used as an instrumental variable for high body mass. Although these 32 alleles explained only 2% of the variance of BMI in the population, we found evidence of a causal link between high body mass and asthma at age 7 years in this cohort5. Possible Mechanisms to Explain the Link If obesity is truly causal in the initiation of asthma in children, there have been a number of mechanisms advanced to explain this. A plausible explanation is that obesity is associated with systemic inflammation, which may give rise to airway inflammation and asthma. There is evidence that adipocytes are a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines but little evidence that systemic inflammation in obesity is directly associated with airway inflammation. Another possible link would be through promotion of allergic inflammation by adipokine effects on the immune system, but, like us, others have reported stronger associations of obesity with non-atopic asthma, and we found no evidence that obesity is associated with atopy in mid-childhood in our cohort. A specific asthma-obesity phenotype has been suggested in both adults and children, which may be associated with increased asthma severity. There is evidence that obesity in established asthma is associated with poor asthma control, increased exacerbations, and suboptimal response to glucocorticoids. Poor response to steroids may be associated with neutrophil-predominant airway inflammation, consistent with our finding of a stronger association with non-atopic asthma. Other possibilities that have received recent attention are shared genetic loci underpinning both asthma and obesity, epigenetic effects and dietary influences on the microbiome promoting inflammatory responses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the causal role of cardiometabolic risk factors in osteoarthritis (OA) using associated genetic variants., METHODS: We studied 27691 adults from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) and replicated novel findings among 376435 adults from the UK Biobank. Trait-specific polygenic risk scores for LDL- and HDL-cholesterol (LDLC, HDLC), triglycerides (TG), BMI, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were used to test the associations of genetically predicted elevations in each trait with incident OA-diagnosis (n=3559), OA-joint replacement (n=2780), or both (total-OA, n=4226) in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in MDCS, and with self-reported and/or hospital diagnosed OA (n=65213) in the UK Biobank. Multivariable MR, MR-Egger and weighted-median MR were used to adjust for potential pleiotropic biases., RESULTS: In MDCS, genetically predicted higher LDLC was associated with lower risk of OA-diagnosis (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73-0.95 per 1-SD) and total-OA (0.87; 0.78-0.98) which was supported by multivariable MR for OA-diagnosis (0.84; 0.75-0.95) and total-OA (0.87; 0.78-0.97), and by conventional two-sample MR for OA-diagnosis (0.86; 0.75-0.98). MR-Egger indicated no pleiotropic bias. Genetically predicted higher BMI was associated with increased risk for OA-diagnosis (1.65; 1.14-2.41), while MR-Egger indicated pleiotropic bias and larger association with OA-diagnosis (3.25; 1.26-8.39), OA-joint replacement (3.81; 1.39-10.4) and total-OA (3.41; 1.43-8.15). No associations were observed between genetically predicted HDLC, TG, FPG or SBP and OA outcomes. The LDLC associations were replicated in the UK Biobank (0.95; 0.93-0.98)., CONCLUSION: Our MR study provides evidence for causal role of lower LDLC and higher BMI in OA.

AB  - Background and aims: Obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension associate with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the relationship between these traits and T2D may not be causal due to confounding and reverse causation. In the Mendelian randomization approach genetic variants are assumed to be randomly distributed, and can be used as instrumental variables to estimate causal relationships. The aim of this study was to investigate if BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and lipid traits are causally associated with T2D incidence by using genetic risk scores (GRSs) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS) for these traits as instrumental variables. Materials and methods: In total, 27254 non-diabetic participants (61% females) from the population based Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS), collected at baseline during 1990-1996 (age 58+/-8 years, BMI 26+/-4 kg/m2), were genotyped for SNPs associating with BMI (N=31), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC, N=41), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC, N=32), triglycerides (TG, N=26) and SBP (N=29). Trait-specific weighted GRSs were created using PLINK software. During a mean follow-up time of 15+/-4 years, 3248 incident T2D and 3977 cardiovascular disease (CVD) cases were identified. At baseline, BMI and SBP were measured for all individuals and fasting blood lipid levels were analyzed in a random sub-cohort (MDCCC) of 5284 individuals of which 781 developed T2D and 754 CVD. COXregression was used to analyze the association between BMI, SBP, HDLC, LDLC and TG, and incidence of T2D per standard deviation (SD). For Mendelian randomization, a two-stage least square regression method was used with the GRSs as instrumental variables. The predicted values for the first stage of regression of the lipid traits on their respective GRSs were estimated from MDC-CC for all MDCS. Adjustments were made for age, sex, lipidlowering and antihypertensive medication. Results: As expected, baseline levels of higher BMI, SBP, LDLC and TG, and lower HDLC associated with higher incidence of T2D (HR 1.83 [1.78-1.88], P<0.00001; 1.34 [1.29-1.38], P=3x10-59; 1.17 [1.08-1.25], P=0.0004; 1.23 [1.20-1.27], P=2x10-50 and 1.66 [1.51-1.82], P=4x10-27, respectively). The instrumental variable analysis revealed causal effect of increased BMI and SBP but decreased LDLC on higher incidence of T2D (HR 1.92 [1.30-2.83], P=0.001; 1.99 [1.14-3.48], P=0.02 and 1.14 [1.00-1.28], P=0.04, respectively). The instrumental variable analysis did not indicate causality between HDLC or TG and incidence of T2D (0.90 [0.78-1.03], P=0.13 and 1.07 [0.91-1.26], P=0.42, respectively). The instrumental variable analysis indicated a causal effect of increased SBP, LDLC and TG on higher incidence of CVD (HR 1.73 [1.04-2.88], P=0.03; 1.21 [1.08-1.36], P=0.001 and 1.17 [1.01-1.36], P=0.04, respectively). Conclusion: In this large prospective study the Mendelian randomization analysis indicated causal effects of increased BMI and SBP and decreased LDLC on higher incidence of T2D. Our results suggest opposite causal effects of LDLC on the risk of T2D and CVD, and raise the question about the potential deleterious effects of LDLC lowering agents on the risk of T2D. Further, our study emphasizes the importance of weight loss and blood pressure control in prevention of T2D.

AB  - Elevated body mass index (BMI) associates with cardiometabolic traits on observational analysis, yet the underlying causal relationships remain unclear. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses by using a genetic score (GS) comprising 14 BMI-associated SNPs from a recent discovery analysis to investigate the causal role of BMI in cardiometabolic traits and events. We used eight population-based cohorts, including 34,538 European-descent individuals (4,407 type 2 diabetes (T2D), 6,073 coronary heart disease (CHD), and 3,813 stroke cases). A 1 kg/m(2) genetically elevated BMI increased fasting glucose (0.18 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12-0.24), fasting insulin (8.5%; 95% CI = 5.9-11.1), interleukin-6 (7.0%; 95% CI = 4.0-10.1), and systolic blood pressure (0.70 mmHg; 95% CI = 0.24-1.16) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.02 mmol/l; 95% CI = -0.03 to -0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; -0.04 mmol/l; 95% CI = -0.07 to -0.01). Observational and causal estimates were directionally concordant, except for LDL-C. A 1 kg/m(2) genetically elevated BMI increased the odds of T2D (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.18-1.36) but did not alter risk of CHD (OR 1.01; 95% CI = 0.94-1.08) or stroke (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.95-1.12). A meta-analysis incorporating published studies reporting 27,465 CHD events in 219,423 individuals yielded a pooled OR of 1.04 (95% CI = 0.97-1.12) per 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. In conclusion, we identified causal effects of BMI on several cardiometabolic traits; however, whether BMI causally impacts CHD risk requires further evidence.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether body mass index (BMI) has a causal effect on social and socioeconomic factors, including whether both high and low BMI can be detrimental. Design: Mendelian Randomization, using genetic variants for BMI to obtain unconfounded estimates, and non-linear Mendelian Randomization. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 378,244 men and women of European ancestry, mean age 57 (SD 8 years). Main outcome measures: Townsend deprivation index, income, age completed full time education, degree level education, job class, employment status, cohabiting relationship status, participation in leisure and social activities, visits from friends and family, and having someone to confide in. Results: Higher BMI was causally associated with higher deprivation, lower income, fewer years of education, lower odds of degree-level education and skilled employment. For example, a 1 SD higher genetically-determined BMI (4.8kg/m2 in UK Biobank) was associated with 1,660 UK pounds less income per annum [95%CI: 950, 2,380]. Non-linear Mendelian Randomization provided evidence that both low BMI (bottom decile, <22kg/m2) and high BMI (top seven deciles, >24.6kg/m2) can increase deprivation and reduce income. In men only, higher BMI was related to lower participation in leisure and social activities. There was no evidence of causal effects of BMI on visits from friends and family or in having someone to confide in. Non-linear Mendelian Randomization analysis showed that low BMI (bottom three deciles, <23.5kg/m2) reduces the odds of cohabiting with a partner or spouse for men, whereas high BMI (top two deciles, >30.7kg/m2) reduces the odds of cohabitation with a partner or spouse for women. Conclusions: BMI affects social and socioeconomic outcomes, with both high and low BMI being detrimental for some measures of SEP. This suggests that in addition to health benefits, maintaining healthy ranges of BMI across the population could have benefits both for individuals and society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking influences body weight, but there is little evidence as to whether body mass index (BMI) and body dissatisfaction increase smoking initiation in adolescents., METHODS: We evaluated the association between measured BMI, body dissatisfaction and latent classes of smoking initiation (never smokers, experimenters, late onset regular smokers, early onset regular smokers) in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. In observational analyses we used BMI (N=3754) and body dissatisfaction at age 10.5 years (N=3349). In Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis, we used a BMI genetic risk score of 76 single nucleotide polymorphisms (N=4017)., RESULTS: In females, higher BMI was associated with increased odds of early onset regular smoking (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.18) compared to being a never smoker, but not clearly associated with experimenting with smoking (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.10) or late onset regular smoking (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.09). No clear evidence was found for associations between BMI and smoking initiation classes in males (p-value for sex interaction<=0.001). Body dissatisfaction was associated with increased odds of late-onset regular smoking (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.32, 1.99) in males and females combined (P-value for sex interaction=0.32). There was no clear evidence for an association between the BMI genetic risk score and smoking latent classes in males or females but estimates were imprecise., CONCLUSIONS: BMI in females and body dissatisfaction in males and females are associated with increased odds of smoking initiation, highlighting these as potentially important factors for consideration in smoking prevention strategies.

AB  - Sarcopenic-obesity (SO) and Dynapenic-obesity (DO) is characterized by excess body fat and decreased muscle mass and strength, respectively. It is common and affecting > 12% of U.S. adults aged >= 60 years. As a growing number of US seniors are living longer and an epidemic of obesity, SO has become a major public health burden. Although obesity is a known risk factor for major adverse health outcomes, emerging evidence shows that older adults with SO have an even greater risk on fractures, cardiovascular diseases, mobility impairment and disability compared to those with obesity or sarcopenia alone. Identifying genetic risk factors for SO and DO and their association with fracture may help to understand the underlying biology and identify new molecular targets for treatments. We performed a GWAS in 3,763 Framingham men and women participants > 50 years with 2.6 million SNPs under an additive model adjusted for potential confounders. To identify unique genetic determinants associated with SO only, we applied a mixed-effect multinomial-logit model, which accounts for the relations among obesity alone, sarcopenia alone and SO when estimating the association between SNPs and SO. We defined SO using fat and muscle mass (DXA appendicular lean mass divided by height ); and DO using fat mass and muscle strength (lowest sex-specific tertile of grip strength). Obesity was defined as total body fat % (DXA) >30 in men and >40 in women. We classified 11%, 48% and 10% of participants with SO, obesity alone and sarcopenia alone, respectively. We classified 10%, 47% and 7% of participants with DO, obesity alone and sarcopenia alone, respectively. We found SNPs significantly associated with SO only, but not obesity or sarcopenia alone, i.e, SNPs located in or near MANBA, CENPE, PGK2 (associated with SO) and FN1 (associated with DO) gene. Of note, a few of these SNPs were also reported to be associated with diabetes, restless leg syndrome or subclinical atherosclerosis from other GWAS. We found SNPs significantly associated with obesity alone were not found to be associated with SO (or DO). Several of the top SNPs were also found associated with osteoporotic fractures by mendelian randomization analyses. The top findings (p < 5x10-5) are further replicating in independent samples. In conclusion, our results reveal novel candidate genes associated with SO and fracture, but not with obesity or sarcopenia alone, which suggests that underlying pathophysiology of SO may be different from fatness alone and/or muscle weakness alone.

Thirty-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 25 SNPs and 41SNPs were selected as instrumental variables for waist-to-hip ratio adjust BMI (WHRadjBMI), waist circumference adjust BMI (WCadjBMI) and hip circumference adjust BMI (HIPadjBMI), respectively to test the causal effects of maternal central obesity on birth size and puberty height using an inversevariance- weighted approach. Results: In this MR analysis, we found no evidence between genetic instrumental variables for waist circumference (WC) or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and the outcomes. We observed one standard deviation (SD) increase in hip circumference (HC) was associated with a 0.392 SD increase in birth length (p=1.1x10-6) and a 0.168 SD increase in birth weight (p=7.1x10-5), respectively. In addition, higher genetically predicted maternal HP was strongly associated with the puberty heights (0.835 SD, p=8.4x10-10). However, HP was not associated with head circumference (p=0.172). Conclusion: A genetic predisposition to higher maternal HC was causally associated with larger offspring birth weight, higher birth length, and puberty height independent of maternal BMI. However, we found no evidence of a causal association between maternal WC, WHR and birth size.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Observational studies showed that obesity is a major risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, conventional epidemiology studies are vulnerable to residual bias from confounding factors. We aimed to explore the causality of obesity in development of PAD using Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach., METHODS: A MR analysis was performed in 11,477 community-dwelling adults aged 40 years and above recruited from two nearby communities during 2011-2013 in Shanghai, China. We genotyped 14 body mass index (BMI) associated common variants identified and validated in East Asians. PAD was defined as ankle-to-brachial index (ABI) <0.90 or >1.40. Weighted BMI genetic risk score (GRS) was used as the Instrumental Variable (IV)., RESULTS: After adjusted for confounding factors, we found that each standard deviation (SD, 2.76 points) increase in BMI-GRS was associated with 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.49) kg/m(2) increase in BMI (P < 0.0001) and an odds ratio (OR) for PAD of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.07-1.27; P = 0.0004). Compared with the lowest quartile of BMI-GRS, the second, third and highest quartile associated with 9%, 19% and 45% increment of PAD risk, respectively (P for trend = 0.002). In the MR analysis, we demonstrated a causal relationship between obesity and PAD (OR = 1.44 per BMI-unit, 95% CI: 1.18-1.75; P = 0.0003)., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that obesity may be causally associated with PAD after controlling for the potential intermediate factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has been shown to be associated with depression and it has been suggested that higher body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of depression and other common mental disorders. However, the causal relationship remains unclear and Mendelian randomisation, a form of instrumental variable analysis, has recently been employed to attempt to resolve this issue., AIMS: To investigate whether higher BMI increases the risk of major depression., METHOD: Two instrumental variable analyses were conducted to test the causal relationship between obesity and major depression in RADIANT, a large case-control study of major depression. We used a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FTO and a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 32 SNPs with well-established associations with BMI., RESULTS: Linear regression analysis, as expected, showed that individuals carrying more risk alleles of FTO or having higher score of GRS had a higher BMI. Probit regression suggested that higher BMI is associated with increased risk of major depression. However, our two instrumental variable analyses did not support a causal relationship between higher BMI and major depression (FTO genotype: coefficient -0.03, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.13, P = 0.73; GRS: coefficient -0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.07, P = 0.62)., CONCLUSIONS: Our instrumental variable analyses did not support a causal relationship between higher BMI and major depression. The positive associations of higher BMI with major depression in probit regression analyses might be explained by reverse causality and/or residual confounding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have associated adiposity with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, such studies do not establish a causal relationship. To minimise bias from confounding we performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis to examine the relationship between adiposity and CRC., METHODS: We used SNPs associated with adult body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), childhood obesity and birth weight as instrumental variables in a MR analysis of 9254 CRC cases and 18 386 controls., RESULTS: In the MR analysis, the odds ratios (ORs) of CRC risk per unit increase in BMI, WHR and childhood obesity were 1.23 (95% CI: 1.02-1.49, P=0.033), 1.59 (95% CI: 1.08-2.34, P=0.019) and 1.07 (95% CI: 1.03-1.13, P=0.018), respectively. There was no evidence for association between birth weight and CRC (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 0.89-1.67, P=0.22). Combining these data with a concurrent MR-based analysis for BMI and WHR with CRC risk (totalling to 18 190 cases, 27 617 controls) provided increased support, ORs for BMI and WHR were 1.26 (95% CI: 1.10-1.44, P=7.7 x 10(-4)) and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.14-1.72, P=1.2 x 10(-3)), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further evidence for a strong causal relationship between adiposity and the risk of developing CRC highlighting the urgent need for prevention and treatment of adiposity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several obesity-related factors have been associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but it is unclear which individual factors directly influence risk. We addressed this question using genetic markers as proxies for putative risk factors and evaluated their relation to RCC risk in a mendelian randomization (MR) framework. This methodology limits bias due to confounding and is not affected by reverse causation., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genetic markers associated with obesity measures, blood pressure, lipids, type 2 diabetes, insulin, and glucose were initially identified as instrumental variables, and their association with RCC risk was subsequently evaluated in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 10,784 RCC patients and 20,406 control participants in a 2-sample MR framework. The effect on RCC risk was estimated by calculating odds ratios (ORSD) for a standard deviation (SD) increment in each risk factor. The MR analysis indicated that higher body mass index increases the risk of RCC (ORSD: 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-1.70), with comparable results for waist-to-hip ratio (ORSD: 1.63, 95% CI 1.40-1.90) and body fat percentage (ORSD: 1.66, 95% CI 1.44-1.90). This analysis further indicated that higher fasting insulin (ORSD: 1.82, 95% CI 1.30-2.55) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; ORSD: 1.28, 95% CI 1.11-1.47), but not systolic blood pressure (ORSD: 0.98, 95% CI 0.84-1.14), increase the risk for RCC. No association with RCC risk was seen for lipids, overall type 2 diabetes, or fasting glucose., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence for an etiological role of insulin in RCC, as well as confirmatory evidence that obesity and DBP influence RCC risk.

AB  - The causal role of obesity in the development of depression remains uncertain. We applied instrumental-variables regression (Mendelian randomization) to examine the association of adolescent and adult body mass index (BMI) with adult depressive symptoms. Participants were from the Young Finns prospective cohort study (n = 1731 persons, 2844 person-observations), with repeated measurements of BMI and depressive symptoms (modified Beck's Depression Inventory). Genetic risk score of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously identified as robust genetic markers of body weight was used as a proxy for variation in BMI. In standard linear regression analysis, higher adult depressive symptoms were predicted by higher adolescent BMI (B = 0.33, CI = 0.06-0.60, P = 0.017) and adult BMI (B = 0.47, CI = 0.32-0.63, P < 0.001). These associations were replicated in instrumental-variables analysis with genetic risk score as instrument (B = 1.96, CI = 0.03-3.90, P = 0.047 for adolescent BMI; B = 1.08, CI = 0.11-2.04, P = 0.030 for adult BMI). The association for adolescent BMI was significantly stronger in the instrumented analysis compared to standard regression (P = 0.04). These findings provide additional evidence to support a causal role for high BMI in increasing symptoms of depression. However, the present analysis also demonstrates potential limitations of applying Mendelian randomization when using complex phenotypes. Copyright © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Chronotype (morning or evening person) and sleep duration are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes but the causal directions of these associations are uncertain. Using 107,634 individuals from the UK Biobank study and self-reported "morningness," we generated a chronotype score and observed strong associations between this score and BMI (effect size = -0.08 kg/m2 per unit score increase in "morningness," P=1.7x10-12) and type 2 diabetes (OR = 0.94 per unit score increase in "morningness," P= 4.1x10-6) and between sleep duration and BMI (effect size = -0.09 kg/m2 per extra hour slept, P=4.6x10-12) and type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.03 per extra hour slept, P=3.1x10-2). We performed a genome wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with chronotype and sleep duration. We identified 9 loci (P<5x10-8) influencing chronotype. The top signal was in RGS16 which has a known role in circadian rhythm regulation. Other signals include a variant downstream of TRAF3IP1 which has previously been associated with iris development and function, and another within HTR6, a serotonin receptor gene. We also replicated a previously reported association with sleep duration (0.04 hours per allele, P=7x10-14) near PAX8 and identified two putative variants in VRK2 (0.033 and 0.027 hours per allele P=1.2x10-9, P=7.6x10-9). To investigate the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes with chronotype and sleep duration, we performed Mendelian randomization. We constructed weighted genetic risk scores for BMI and type 2 diabetes, using previously published results. We found evidence that higher BMI has a causal effect on Chronotype (P=8x10-3) with a 1 SD higher BMI (4.6kg/m2) being causally associated with a 0.06 SD move towards morningness. We found no evidence for the effect of either BMI (P=0.44) or type 2 diabetes risk (P=0.35) on sleep duration. In conclusion we identified novel variants associated with sleep phenotypes and showed that higher BMI has a likely causal effect on chronotype.

AB  - Disrupted circadian rhythms and reduced sleep duration are associated with several human diseases, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes, but until recently, little was known about the genetic factors influencing these heritable traits. We performed genome-wide association studies of self-reported chronotype (morning/evening person) and self-reported sleep duration in 128,266 white British individuals from the UK Biobank study. Sixteen variants were associated with chronotype (P<5x10-8), including variants near the known circadian rhythm genes RGS16 (1.21 odds of morningness, 95% CI [1.15, 1.27], P = 3x10-12) and PER2 (1.09 odds of morningness, 95% CI [1.06, 1.12], P = 4x10-10). The PER2 signal has previously been associated with iris function. We sought replication using self-reported data from 89,283 23andMe participants; thirteen of the chronotype signals remained associated at P<5x10-8 on meta-analysis and eleven of these reached P<0.05 in the same direction in the 23andMe study. We also replicated 9 additional variants identified when the 23andMe study was used as a discovery GWAS of chronotype (all P<0.05 and meta-analysis P<5x10-8). For sleep duration, we replicated one known signal in PAX8 (2.6 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.9, 3.2], P = 5.7x10-16) and identified and replicated two novel associations at VRK2 (2.0 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.3, 2.7], P = 1.2x10-9; and 1.6 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.1, 2.2], P = 7.6x10-9). Although we found genetic correlation between chronotype and BMI (rG = 0.056, P = 0.05); undersleeping and BMI (rG = 0.147, P = 1x10-5) and oversleeping and BMI (rG = 0.097, P = 0.04), Mendelian Randomisation analyses, with limited power, provided no consistent evidence of causal associations between BMI or type 2 diabetes and chronotype or sleep duration. Our study brings the total number of loci associated with chronotype to 22 and with sleep duration to three, and provides new insights into the biology of sleep and circadian rhythms in humans.

AB  - Observational studies suggest that higher birth weight (BW) is associated with increased risk of breast cancer in adult life. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to assess whether this association is causal. Sixty independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated at P < 5 x 10-8 with BW were used to construct (1) a 41-SNP instrumental variable (IV) for univariable MR after removing SNPs with pleiotropic associations with other breast cancer risk factors and (2) a 49-SNP IV for multivariable MR after filtering SNPs for data availability. BW predicted by the 41-SNP IV was not associated with overall breast cancer risk in inverse-variance weighted (IVW) univariable MR analysis of genetic association data from 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls (odds ratio = 0.86 per 500 g higher BW; 95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.01). Sensitivity analyses using four alternative methods and three alternative IVs, including an IV with 59 of the 60 BW-associated SNPs, yielded similar results. Multivariable MR adjusting for the effects of the 49-SNP IV on birth length, adult height, adult body mass index, age at menarche, and age at menopause using IVW and MR-Egger methods provided estimates consistent with univariable analyses. Results were also similar when all analyses were repeated after restricting to estrogen receptor-positive or -negative breast cancer cases. Point estimates of the odds ratios from most analyses performed indicated an inverse relationship between genetically-predicted BW and breast cancer. Thus, there is little evidence from MR to suggest that the previously observed association between higher BW and increased risk of breast cancer in adult life is causal.

Thus, genetically-predicted higher BW was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in adult life in our MR study.

AB  - Orho-Melander et al. recently reported that lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) as predicted by the T-allele of the variant rs12916 in HMGCR is associated with a decreased risk of developing breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82-0.96]. This analysis was embedded in a wider Mendelian randomization (MR) study performed using genotype data from a prospective cohort of 26,589 individuals that included 16,022 women and 1176 incident breast cancer cases. HMGCR encodes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the enzyme inhibited by statins. The T-allele of rs12916 is associated with reduced HMGCR expression and therefore, in principle, its effects should be analogous to the effects of lifelong statin administration starting at birth. The MR study of Orho-Melander et al. also found that a genome-wide LDLC score based on 32 independent LDLC-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was not associated with breast cancer. In light of this finding, they suggest that the protective effect of the rs12916 T-allele on breast cancer may either be specific to LDLC lowering via genetic inhibition of HMGCR or be the result of a distinct mechanism that is regulated by rs12916 and HMGCR. Using two-sample MR, a larger data set for breast cancer risk outcomes, and a six SNP HMGCR-specific genetic instrument, we confirm the association between lower genetically-predicted LDLC and decreased breast cancer risk. We also confirm that LDLC as predicted by 32 SNPs genome-wide is not associated with breast cancer. However, we note that at least one of the six HMGCR SNPs -- rs12916 -- is strongly associated (P < 5e-8) with body mass index (BMI) based on publicly available genetic association summary statistics. It has previously been identified that genetically-predicted BMI has an inverse association with breast cancer risk. We use multivariable MR to show that adjusting for the BMI associations at the HMGCR SNPs attenuates the association between lower LDLC and decreased breast cancer risk. These findings lend support to BMI, rather than LDLC, being a more likely mechanism underlying the potential protective effect of genetic inhibition of HMGCR on breast cancer risk that was identified by Orho-Melander et al.

AB  - Lean mass is positively associated with bone mineral density (BMD). However, the relationship between adiposity and BMD is controversial. It is unclear if the observational association reflects a causal effect of fat mass on BMD. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies using variants in the FTO and MC4R as genetic instruments for adiposity have suggested that fat mass causally influence BMD. However, it is possible that these genetic variants pleiotropically influence lean mass and affect BMD through pathways independent of adiposity, invalidating a core assumptions of MR. To investigate whether adiposity causally affects BMD, we examined the relationship between fat mass and BMD [at the skull(SK),upper-(UL)andlower-limbs(LL)]in5221ALSPACchildren using body mass index (BMI) associated SNPs, including a variant near ADCY3 that was associated with fat but not lean mass. Conventional MR analyses were performed in addition to new extensions of the MR method: MR Egger regression and multivariable MR which are more robusttopossible confoundingeffects duetohorizontalpleiotropy, andin the case of multivariable MR, account for the effect of lean mass. Observationally, fat mass was positively related to BMD at all sites, but more weakly at the skull. IV analyses suggested that fat mass was causally related to limb BMD, but not SK-BMD. Multivariable MR, Egger regression and IV analyses involving the ADCY3 variant suggested a positive causal effect of adiposity on all sites except the skull and that an effect was present after taking lean mass into account. Reciprocal IV analyses showed no evidence of reverse causality. Our results suggest that adiposity is causally related to increased BMD at all sites except the skull, perhaps reflecting positive effects of loading on bone formation. Our results illustrate how MR can be used profitably to investigate clinical questions relevant to osteoporosis. Medical Research Council program Grant (MC-UU-12013/4).

AB  - Background: Thyroid cancer (TC) is one of the endocrine tumors of which incidence rates have shown an upward trend worldwide. Obesity, another endemic health issue, has been recently reported in the association with increased TC risk. We attempted to examine if there is a causal association between body mass index (BMI) and TC using a Mendelian randomization approach. Methods: Total 17,935 healthy individuals from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study and 1,214 TC cases from National Cancer Center, Korea, and Seoul National University Hospital were selected with age, sex, BMI, and genetic information. Based on the thirteen previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI, we constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) as a genetic instrumental variable (IV) representing BMI independent of possible confounding. IV analysis was performed using the ratio (or, Wald) method to test causal association. Results: The odds of TC were 2.6 times higher in females than males. The cases were younger than the controls. The F-statistic from the regression of BMI on BMI GRS (IV) was 157.2 (usually, F larger than 10 indicates a strong and valid IV), and the IV explained 1.10% of the phenotypic variance for BMI. From IV analysis, genetically instrumented BMI was not associated with TC risk (causal odds ratio per 1kg/m2 increase in BMI 0.98 [0.79 - 1.20 95% confidence interval]). Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that positive association between obesity and TC risk repeatedly reported from several meta-analyses may be null. Further investigation is needed as the incidence rates differ in different ethnicity.

AB  - The Mendelian randomization approach exploits genetic variants to improve causal inference when using observational data. The authors examined the relation between long-term obesity and common mental disorders (CMD) by utilizing the known relation between fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype and body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)). Data collection in 2,981 men and 1,164 women (mean age at baseline = 44 years) from the Whitehall II Study (London, United Kingdom) included 4 repeated examinations of BMI and CMD over a 19-year follow-up period (1985-2004), plus an assessment of FTO polymorphism rs1421085. In men, there was an association of FTO genotype with all measures of adiposity (mean BMI, number of times obese, and, in nonobese persons, number of times overweight). FTO was also associated with CMD in men. This was independent of adiposity, thus potentially violating the exclusion restriction assumption. According to both conventional and FTO-instrumented regression analysis, measurement of obesity was associated with an increased occurrence of CMD. In the FTO-instrumented analysis only, higher BMI and overweight were also associated with CMD. In women, there was no link between FTO and adiposity. Mendelian randomization analyses supported the status of long-term obesity as a risk factor for CMD in men-a finding that should be interpreted cautiously because the function of the FTO gene is unknown.

AB  - AIMS: Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants related to environmentally modifiable risk factors in an attempt to improve causal inference from observational data. We examined the effect of lifetime body mass index (BMI) on adult carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and various atherosclerotic risk factors by using both Mendelian randomization and conventional analyses., METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2230 individuals (1218 women), aged 3-18 at study induction, took part in clinical examinations in 1980, 1983, 1986, and, most recently, 2001 when they were aged 24-39. In these analyses we utilized the known relation between FTO polymorphism rs9939609 and BMI. The dose-response association between the number of A alleles in FTO and higher mean BMI from childhood to adulthood was confirmed, but no associations with potential confounding factors were observed. In standard regression models, lifetime BMI was associated with adult CIMT, lifetime systolic blood pressure, adult fasting glucose, and adult HOMA-index. When variation in FTO was used as an instrument for unconfounded BMI levels, similar or larger effects of lifetime BMI on all these phenotypes were found, although with wider confidence intervals., CONCLUSION: Mutually supportive results from Mendelian randomization and standard regression models strengthen the evidence of the effect of lifetime BMI on atherosclerosis risk in young adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: UK Biobank is the world's largest repository for phenotypic and genotypic information for individuals of European ancestry. Here, we leverage UK Biobank to understand the inherited basis for venous thromboembolism (VTE), a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality., METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 3290 VTE cases and 116 868 controls through billing code-based phenotyping. We performed a genome-wide association study for VTE with =9 000 000 imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We performed a phenome-wide association study for a genetic risk score of 10 VTE-associated variants. To assess whether obesity is a causal factor for VTE, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis using a genetic risk score instrument composed of 68 body mass index-associated variants. The genome-wide association study for VTE replicated previous findings at the F5, F2, ABO, F11, and FGG loci. We identified 1 new locus-ZFPM2 rs4602861-at genome-wide significance (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.15; P=4.9x10-10) and a new independent variant at the F2 locus (rs3136516; odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.13; P=7.60x10-9). In a phenome-wide association study, a 10 single-nucleotide polymorphism VTE genetic risk score was associated with coronary artery disease (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.10 per unit increase in VTE odds; P=1.08x10-9). In a Mendelian randomization analysis, genetically elevated body mass index (a 1 SD increase) was associated with 57% higher risk of VTE (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.97; P=0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: For common diseases such as VTE, biobanks provide potential to perform genetic discovery, explore the phenotypic consequences for disease-associated variants, and test causal inference.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that obesity is causally associated with deep venous thrombosis (DVT)., DESIGN: A Mendelian randomization design., SETTING: The Copenhagen General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study combined., SUBJECTS: Body mass index (BMI) measurements were available for 87, 574 individuals of Danish descent from the adult general population. All subjects completed questionnaires and were genotyped for the FTO rs9939609 variant., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: First events of DVT with or without pulmonary embolism (PE)., ANALYSIS: The results were assessed using Cox regression, instrumental variable analysis and Poisson regression., RESULTS: Observationally, the risk of DVT increased with increasing BMI (P-trend < 0.0001). The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for DVT was 1.3 (1.1-1.6) in overweight, 1.8 (1.4-2.2) in moderately obese and 3.4 (2.6-4.6) in severely obese compared with normal-weight individuals. For DVT complicated by PE, corresponding hazard ratios (95% CI) were 1.2 (0.8-1.8), 2.1 (1.3-3.5) and 5.1 (2.8-9.2). FTO AA versus TT genotype was associated with a 2.4% increase in BMI with hazard ratios (95% CI) of 1.09 (0.95-1.25) for DVT and 1.54 (1.12-2.10) for DVT complicated by PE. In instrumental variable analysis, the causal odds ratio (95% CI) for an increase in BMI of 1 kg m(-2) was 1.13 (0.92-1.39) for DVT alone and 1.86 (1.14-3.02) for DVT complicated by PE. The absolute 10-year risk of DVT in a high-risk group (i.e. those aged >60 years and homozygous for Factor V Leiden) was 35% in obese individuals and 18% in normal-weight individuals., CONCLUSION: A strong observational association between obesity and DVT with or without PE, supported by a direct genetic association between the obesity-specific locus FTO and DVT with PE, implies that obesity is likely to be causally associated with DVT.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether overall obesity (as measured by BMI) and abdominal obesity (as measured by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI) are associated with gout risk and serum urate concentrations using Mendelian randomization., Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI (n = 97) and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (n = 49) were analysed for association with gout risk in 2115 gout cases and 67 259 controls, and with serum urate concentrations in 110 347 individuals from the Global Urate Genetics Consortium., Results: Genetically higher BMI, but not waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, was positively associated with risk of gout and serum urate concentrations. Each standard deviation (about 4.6 kg/m2) increase in genetically predicted BMI was associated with an odds ratio of gout of 2.24 (95% CI 1.70, 2.95; P = 8.4 x 10-9) and with a 0.30 mg/dl (95% CI 0.25, 0.35; P = 1.6 x 10-36) increase in serum urate concentrations., Conclusion: These findings provide support that overall obesity may be a risk factor for gout and is associated with higher serum urate concentrations.

AB  - Objective: To implement a mendelian randomization (MR) approach to determine whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and body mass index (BMI) are causally associated with specific ischemic stroke subtypes. Methods: MR estimates of the association between each possible risk factor and ischemic stroke subtypes were calculated with inverse-variance weighted (conventional) and weighted median approaches, and MR-Egger regression was used to explore pleiotropy. The number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used as instrumental variables was 49 for T2D, 36 for fasting glucose, 18 for fasting insulin, and 77 for BMI. Genome-wide association study data of SNPstroke associations were derived from METASTROKE and the Stroke Genetics Network (n 5 18,476 ischemic stroke cases and 37,296 controls). Results: Conventional MR analysis showed associations between genetically predicted T2D and large artery stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.40, p 5 3.3 3 1027) and small vessel stroke (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.33, p 5 8.9 3 1025) but not cardioembolic stroke (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97-1.15, p 5 0.17). The association of T2D with large artery stroke but not small vessel stroke was consistent in a sensitivity analysis using the weighted median method, and there was no evidence of pleiotropy. Genetically predicted fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels and BMI were not statistically significantly associated with any ischemic stroke subtype.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Aims: In observational studies, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with high risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). We tested the hypothesis that a high liver fat content or a diagnosis of NAFLD is a causal risk factor for IHD., Methods and results: In a cohort study of the Danish general population (n = 94 708/IHD = 10 897), we first tested whether a high liver fat content or a diagnosis of NAFLD was associated observationally with IHD. Subsequently, using Mendelian randomization, we tested whether a genetic variant in the gene encoding the protein patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 protein (PNPLA3), I148M (rs738409), a strong and specific cause of high liver fat content and NAFLD, was causally associated with the risk of IHD. We found that the risk of IHD increased stepwise with increasing liver fat content (in quartiles) up to an odds ratio (OR) of 2.41 (1.28-4.51)(P-trend = 0.004). The corresponding OR for IHD in individuals with vs. without NAFLD was 1.65 (1.34-2.04)(P = 3x10-6). PNPLA3 I148M was associated with a stepwise increase in liver fat content of up to 28% in MM vs. II-homozygotes (P-trend = 0.0001) and with ORs of 2.03 (1.52-2.70) for NAFLD (P = 3x10-7), 3.28 (2.37-4.54) for cirrhosis (P = 4x10-12), and 0.95 (0.86-1.04) for IHD (P = 0.46). In agreement, in meta-analysis (N = 279 013/IHD = 71 698), the OR for IHD was 0.98 (0.96-1.00) per M-allele vs. I-allele. The OR for IHD per M-allele higher genetically determined liver fat content was 0.98 (0.94-1.03) vs. an observational estimate of 1.05 (1.02-1.09)(P for comparison = 0.02)., Conclusion: Despite confirming the known observational association of liver fat content and NAFLD with IHD, lifelong, genetically high liver fat content was not causally associated with risk of IHD. These results suggest that the observational association is due to confounding or reverse causation. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effect of adiposity on common mental disorder (CMD). Methods Data from a large (N = 53,221) general population cohort of 20 to 99-year old adults were used. CMD was assessed using four questions that asked about: feeling stressed; not accomplishing anything; wanting to give-up living; and regular use of antidepressants. FTO rs9939609 and MC4R rs17782313 loci were used as instrumental variables for genetically determined adiposity quantified by body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR). Findings In conventional multivariable analyses BMI and WHR as measures of common adiposity were positively associated with CMD outcomes. The odds ratio of using antidepressants for each additional 1standard deviation increase for BMI was 1.05 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.09) and for WHR was 1.17 (95%CI: 1.13, 1.21) in the fully adjusted multivariable analyses. By contrast, instrumental variables suggested that genetically elevated adiposity was inversely related to CMD: the corresponding odds ratio in instrumental variable analyses were 0.57 (95%CI: 0.31, 1.02) and 0.30 (95%CI: 0.10, 0.89) (p-values for heterogeneity between the two approaches = 0.045 and 0.015, respectively). Interpretation: Genetically determined adiposity protects against CMD. This could be explained by biological pathways involving free fatty acids and serotonin. The contrasting positive associations of common adiposity with CMD in multivariable analyses might be explained by residual confounding, reverse causality or could be the result of social stigmatisation of those who are overweight or obese.

AB  - Objective. We used genetic variants that are robustly associated with adiposity to examine the causal association of adiposity with psychological distress. Methods. We examined the association of adiposity with psychological distress in a large (N=53221) general population cohort of 20- to 99-year-old adults from Copenhagen, Denmark. Psychological distress was assessed using four questions that asked about: feeling stressed; not accomplishing very much; wanting to give up; and regular use of antidepressants/sedatives. We used the genetic loci FTO rs9939609 and MC4R rs17782313 as instrumental variables for adiposity quantified by body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR). Results. In conventional multivariable analyses, BMI and WHR were positively associated with distress. For example, the odds ratio of reporting not accomplishing for each additional standard deviation increase for BMI was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.13) and for WHR was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.13) in the fully adjusted analyses. In contrast, instrumental variable analyses showed an inverse association of adiposity on distress; corresponding odds ratio in instrumental variable analyses was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.89) for BMI and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.94) for WHR (P-values for difference between the two approaches both= 0.001). Conclusion. The inverse associations of adiposity and psychological distress when genetic variants are used as instrumental variables could be explained by biological pathways linking adiposity and distress. The positive associations of adiposity with distress in multivariable analyses might be explained by residual confounding or reverse causality. © 2011 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.

AB  - Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.Copyright © The Author 2017.

AB  - Observational studies have shown that obesity is a major risk factor for hypertension, but unmeasured confounding factors may exist. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal effect of obesity on hypertension.The MR analysis was performed in a well-defined community cohort study of 8832 middle-aged (40-69 years) adults in Korea enrolled from 2001 to 2013. We used baseline hypertension and newly diagnosed hypertension during the 10-year follow-up period as the outcome variable. Genetic risk score associated with body mass index (BMI GRS) was used as the instrumental variable (IV) to measure the causal relationship between obesity and hypertension. The IV estimate of causal odds ratio (OR) was derived using the Wald ratio estimator and then exponentiation to express the result as an OR.In the multivariable model adjusting for age, sex, study area, education, smoking, and current alcohol consumption, each 1 kg/m increase in BMI was associated with a 19% (OR: 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.21) increase in hypertension risk. We selected 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (P < 1.0 x 10) associated with BMI by genome-wide screening using linear regression and created 6 types of GRS. We demonstrated that each standard-deviation increase in BMI GRS was associated with a 5% to 6% (OR: 1.05-1.06) increased risk of hypertension (all P < .05). Using BMI GRS as the IV, we found a causal relationship between BMI and hypertension (OR: 1.13-1.26, all P < .05 except weighted GRS [n = 6]).Using Mendelian randomization, we found that obesity is causally associated with hypertension. This information will have important public health implications, supporting evidence that obesity-reduction programs will reduce the incidence of hypertension.

AB  - Aims: The Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, replacing environmental risk factors with genetic instrumental variables, is widely accepted as a causal effect model. The cotwin-control method, particularly for monozygotic twins (MZ), has long been suggested as a powerful approach by matching genomic constitutions and nuisance environmental covariates, otherwise hard to adjust. In this study, we would like to compare the two approaches by empirically examining results from the two analyses using the Healthy Twin Study (HTS) in Korea. We chose general obesity, central obesity, and bone health as an example because conflicting reports are still submitted on this important public health issue, particularly according to menopause status. Methods: MR Analysis: To obtain valid IVs for different adiposity measures, we conducted genome-wide association (GWA) screens using two cohort studies inKorea (total 17,935). The MR analysis was performed using the HTS (n = 3,479). Body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRaBMI) as a central obesity indicator were used as adiposity traits; and bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) measured by DEXA were used as bone health parameters. Cotwin-Control Analysis: We calculated the difference in BMC and BMD within MZ pairs and regressed those differences on the differences in BMI and WHRaBMI for the same pairs. The presence of meaningful associations and the estimated effect sizes were compared. Results: MR Analysis: Traitspecific GRSs were successfully identified for BMI and WHR aBMI (F statistics >10). Both GRSs showed randomized effects over the possible confounders. For weight-bearing bones, BMI IVs showed significant positive associations with BMC (g) (both spinal - men 10.41 [SE 4.19]; premenopausal women (PRE) 6.55 [SE 2.35], and lower limbs - men 23.31[SE 10.39]; PRE 20.75 [SE 6.29]) and BMD (lower limbs only - men 0.019 [SE 0.008]; PRE 0.016 [SE 0.005]); these patterns were not evident for postmenopausal women. Central obesity IVs did not show significant associations with any of the bone parameters across all subgroups. Pooled analyses for all weight-bearing bones for both men and women showed positive BMI associations with BMC/BMD (20.7/0.013). Cotwin-Control Analysis: BMI showed significant associations with all bone parameters BMC/BMD (the estimated effects of 7.35 [SE 1.85]/0.004 [SE .001]); and no significant trend between cotwin difference of WHRaBMI and bone traits. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both MR and cotwin-control analyses will be able to show causal associations by controlling confounders by randomization (MR) or matching (cotwin-control). Our findings also suggest that the estimated effect size might be smaller in cotwin-control analysis, probably because of the overmatching of shared environmental factors within twin pairs.

AB  - Observational studies have shown that vitamin D binding protein (DBP) levels, a key determinant of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) levels, and 25OHD levels themselves both associate with risk of disease. If 25OHD levels have a causal influence on disease, and DBP lies in this causal pathway, then DBP levels should likewise be causally associated with disease. We undertook a Mendelian randomization study to determine whether DBP levels have causal effects on common calcemic and cardiometabolic disease., We measured DBP and 25OHD levels in 2,254 individuals, followed for up to 10 y, in the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos). Using the single nucleotide polymorphism rs2282679 as an instrumental variable, we applied Mendelian randomization methods to determine the causal effect of DBP on calcemic (osteoporosis and hyperparathyroidism) and cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and stroke) and related traits, first in CaMos and then in large-scale genome-wide association study consortia. The effect allele was associated with an age- and sex-adjusted decrease in DBP level of 27.4 mg/l (95% CI 24.7, 30.0; n = 2,254). DBP had a strong observational and causal association with 25OHD levels (p = 3.2x10-19). While DBP levels were observationally associated with calcium and body mass index (BMI), these associations were not supported by causal analyses. Despite well-powered sample sizes from consortia, there were no associations of rs2282679 with any other traits and diseases: fasting glucose (0.00 mmol/l [95% CI -0.01, 0.01]; p = 1.00; n = 46,186); fasting insulin (0.01 pmol/l [95% CI -0.00, 0.01,]; p = 0.22; n = 46,186); BMI (0.00 kg/m2 [95% CI -0.01, 0.01]; p = 0.80; n = 127,587); bone mineral density (0.01 g/cm2 [95% CI -0.01, 0.03]; p = 0.36; n = 32,961); mean arterial pressure (-0.06 mm Hg [95% CI -0.19, 0.07]); p = 0.36; n = 28,775); ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 1.00 [95% CI 0.97, 1.04]; p = 0.92; n = 12,389/62,004 cases/controls); coronary artery disease (OR = 1.02 [95% CI 0.99, 1.05]; p = 0.31; n = 22,233/64,762); or type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.01 [95% CI 0.97, 1.05]; p = 0.76; n = 9,580/53,810)., DBP has no demonstrable causal effect on any of the diseases or traits investigated here, except 25OHD levels. It remains to be determined whether 25OHD has a causal effect on these outcomes independent of DBP., Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.Copyright © 2014 Leong et al.

AB  - Observational studies have suggested anthropometric traits, particularly increased height are associated with an elevated risk of testicular cancer (testicular germ cell tumour). However, there is an inconsistency between study findings, suggesting the possibility of the influence of confounding factors. To examine the association between anthropometric traits and testicular germ cell tumour using an unbiased approach, we performed a Mendelian randomisation study. We used genotype data from genome wide association studies of testicular germ cell tumour totalling 5518 cases and 19,055 controls. Externally weighted polygenic risk scores were created and used to evaluate associations with testicular germ cell tumour risk per one standard deviation (s.d) increase in genetically-defined adult height, adult BMI, adult waist hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), adult hip circumference adjusted for BMI (HIPadjBMI), adult waist circumference adjusted for BMI (WCadjBMI), birth weight (BW) and childhood obesity. Mendelian randomisation analysis did not demonstrate an association between any anthropometric trait and testicular germ cell tumour risk. In particular, despite good power, there was no global evidence for association between height and testicular germ cell tumour. However, three SNPs for adult height individually showed association with testicular germ cell tumour (rs4624820: OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.41-1.55, p = 2.7 x 10-57 ; rs12228415: OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.11-1.22, p = 3.1 x 10-10 ; rs7568069: OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.07-1.18, p = 1.1 x 10-6 ). This Mendelian randomisation analysis, based on the largest testicular germ cell tumour genome wide association dataset to date, does not support a causal etiological association between anthropometric traits and testicular germ cell tumour aetiology. Our findings are more compatible with confounding by shared environmental factors, possibly related to prenatal growth with exposure to these risk factors occurring in utero.

AB  - Obesity shows an inconsistent association with cataract. Causality has not been established. Polymorphisms at the fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) locus are associated with obesity and offer an opportunity to examine the obesity-cataract association using a mendelian randomization approach. The authors conducted a population-based study among Singaporean Malay adults (2004-2006) in which nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataracts were assessed and defined by slit-lamp examination using Lens Opacity Classification System III. Obesity was defined as body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) > or =30. The study included 3,000 subjects, of whom 1,339 (44.6%) had cataract (848 (28.3%) nuclear, 939 (31.3%) cortical, and 285 (9.5%) PSC). After multivariable adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and education, obesity was significantly associated with cortical (odds ratio (OR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.71) and PSC (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.32) cataracts but not nuclear cataract. FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with obesity in this study population were not associated with cortical or PSC cataract but were associated with nuclear cataract (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.58), even in multivariate analyses controlling additionally for body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.55). These results do not support a causal association between obesity and cortical or PSC cataract. The FTO gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of nuclear cataract.

AB  - Observational studies have shown an association between obesity and venous thromboembolism (VTE) but it is not known if observed associations are causal, due to reverse causation or confounding bias. We conducted a Mendelian Randomization study of body mass index (BMI) and VTE. We identified 95 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been previously associated with BMI and assessed the association between genetically predicted high BMI and VTE leveraging data from a previously conducted GWAS within the INVENT consortium comprising a total of 7507 VTE cases and 52,632 controls of European ancestry. Five BMI SNPs were associated with VTE at P < 0.05, with the strongest association seen for the FTO SNP rs1558902 (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12, P = 0.005). In addition, we observed a significant association between genetically predicted BMI and VTE (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.30-1.93 per standard deviation increase in BMI, P = 5.8 x 10-6). Our study provides evidence for a causal relationship between high BMI and risk of VTE. Reducing obesity levels will likely result in lower incidence in VTE.

AB  - Poorer liver function is positively associated with diabetes in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. Observationally, adiposity is associated with poorer liver function. To clarify the etiology, we assessed the association of liver function with adiposity observationally and using two sample MR for validation. In the 'Children of 1997' birth cohort, we used multivariable linear regression to assess the associations of ALT and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (IU/L) at ~17.5 years with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2). Using MR, genetic variants predicting ALT, ALP and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) (100% change in concentration), were applied to genome-wide association studies of BMI, waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) (standard deviations) to obtain unconfounded inverse-variance weighting estimates. Observationally, ALT was positively associated with BMI (0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.11). ALP was inversely associated with BMI (-0.018, 95% CI -0.024 to -0.012). Using MR, ALT was inversely associated with BMI (-0.14, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.07), but not WC or WHR. ALP and GGT were unrelated to adiposity. Poorer liver function might not cause adiposity; instead higher ALT might reduce BMI. Whether ALT contributes to diabetes by reducing muscle mass, given the no association of ALT with WC or WHR, requires investigation.

AB  - Objectives: Epidemiological studies support an association between blood pressure (BP) and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, a causal link is difficult to establish because of shared risk factors for both conditions. A recent Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study using 28 genetic variants associated with systolic BP (SBP) demonstrated that genetically elevated SBP was associated with an increased risk of T2DM. We used updated results from over 800 SNPS associated with blood pressure to establish if higher systolic, diastolic or pulse pressure causally increases risk of T2DM. Method(s): We performed two-sample and multivariable MR analysis using GWAS summary statistics of blood pressure from International Consortium of Blood Pressure and diabetes and metabolic phenotypes obtained from MR-Base. Independent SNPS associated with SBP and DBP were selected that were not pleiotropic with BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose or HbA1c (N = 231). The outcome was T2DM from the DIAGRAM consortium. We performed inverse-variance weighted MR (IVW) as main analyses and MR-Egger regression to explore pleiotropy. Result(s): Two sample analyses showed a causal relationship between genetically determined higher SBP and risk of T2DM (causal estimate per mmHg risk in SBP: OR 1.02[95% CI:1.01-1.03], P = 0.0001; MR Egger: 1.03[1.01-1.05], P = 0.01). Similar results were observed for DBP (1.017 [0.99-1.04], P = 0.07; MR Egger: 1.03[1.0-1.07], P = 0.047). Multivariable MR analysis including BMI and SBP as exposure confirmed the causal effect of SBP on type 2 diabetes (P = 0.004) but not for DBP (P = 0.38). Conclusion(s): Genetically predicted SBP is associated with increased risk of T2DM.

AB  - Objectives: To assess bidirectional effects of anxiety and anorexia nervosa (AN) phenotypes. Design: Two-sample Mendelian randomization. Setting: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortia (PGC), analysis of the UK Biobank sample, and Anxiety Neuro Genetics Study (ANGST) consortium. Participants: European descent participants from the PGC (n = 14,477), UK Biobank (n = 348,219), and ANGST consortium (n = 17,310, and n = 18,186). Main outcome measures: AN diagnosis, worry, anxiety disorder pathology (case-control and quantitative phenotypes). Results: We found evidence of a moderate genetic correlation between worry and AN (Rg = 0.36, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001), and the Mendelian randomization analysis supported a causal influence of worry on AN (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.18 to 3.90, p = 0.01). There was no clear evidence for a causal effect of AN on worry in this study (B = -0.01, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.02, p = 0.55). There was no robust evidence for a causal influence of anxiety disorders on AN (for case-control anxiety disorder phenotype: OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.69, 1.50, p = 0.922; for quantitative anxiety disorder phenotype: OR = 4.26, 95% CI: 0.49, 36.69, p = 0.187). There was no robust evidence for a causal effect of AN on anxiety disorders (for case control anxiety disorder phenotype: OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.72, 1.38, p = 0.981; for quantitative anxiety disorder phenotype: B = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.6=09, p = 0,761). AN and anxiety disorder phenotypes were not genetically correlated (for case-control anxiety disorder phenotype: Rg = 0.10, se = 0.17, p = .56; for quantitative anxiety disorder phenotype: Rg = 0.12, SE = 0.17, p = 0.47). Conclusions: Findings support a role for worry in AN development, highlighting a potential target of future AN prevention efforts. Mechanisms underlying the association should be a focus of future investigation. The relatively small sample sizes of anxiety disorder and AN GWASs may have limited power to detect causal effects; these associations should be studied further.

AB  - Adiposity has been associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in observational studies, but their association may differ according to specific characteristics of studies. In Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, genetic variants are used as instrumental variables (IVs) of exposures to examine causal effects to overcome confounding factors and reverse causation. We performed MR analyses for adiposity (n = 322,154) on risk of CAD (60,801 cases and 123,504 controls) based on the currently largest genome-wide association studies. The estimated associations between adiposity traits and CAD were calculated by an inverse-variance weighted method with and without excluding the IVs, which are associated with the well-known risk factors of CAD. Genetic variants are identified to be associated with the well-known risk factors of CAD by a cross-phenotype meta-analysis method. Our results furnished strong evidence for a causal role of adiposity in risk of CAD, with the odds ratios (ORs) for CAD being 1.53 (95% CI 1.36-1.72) for body mass index (BMI), 1.48 (1.20-1.96) for waist-hip ratio (WHR), and 1.34 (1.07-1.59) for WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), respectively. After excluding mediators-associated IVs from the MR analyses, the corresponding ORs were 1.46 (1.28-1.67) for BMI, 1.39 (1.01-1.93) for WHR, and 1.38 (1.04-1.84) for WHRadjBMI, respectively. Furthermore, our results suggested that central adiposity and general adiposity might pose a similar risk for CAD. In summary, our data supported that genetically driven adiposity traits imposed the risk of CAD independent of blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, glycaemic traits, and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Background Higher body-mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, although the underlying causal associations remain unclear. The conflicting evidence with respect to the magnitude of association between BMI and cardiometabolic diseases lends support to adopting a Mendelian randomisation approach: we aimed to contribute a fairly large amount of data with detailed covariate information to this question. Methods The UK Biobank is a prospective general cohort study of adults aged 40-70 years at baseline (between 2006 and 2010). We examined 119 859 UK Biobank participants with complete cross-sectional phenotypic and genetic data, using a polygenic risk score consisting of 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI from previous genome-wide association studies. We used the polygenic risk score to derive causal estimates using a Mendelian randomisation approach. Cardiometabolic outcomes were based on self-report of clinical diagnosis for each of hypertension, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and blood pressure. This study was conducted under generic approval from the NHS National Research Ethics Service (ref 11/NW/0382). Findings Mendelian randomisation analysis showed significant positive associations (all p values <0*0001) between genetically instrumented higher BMI and risk of hypertension (odds ratio per 1 SD increase in BMI 1*64, 95% CI 1*48-1*83), coronary heart disease (1*35, 1*09-1*69), type 2 diabetes (2*53, 2*04-3*13), diastolic blood pressure (difference per 1 SD increase in BMI [s] 1*65 mmHg, 0*78-2*52) and systolic blood pressure (1*37, 0*88-1*85). These associations were independent of age, sex, Townsend deprivation scores, alcohol intake, and smoking history. Interpretation The results of this study add to the evidence of a causal association between higher BMI and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. This fi nding has relevance for public health policies in countries struggling with increasing obesity levels. BMI is a modifiable risk factor for ameliorating risk of cardiometabolic disease. This report advances the fi eld by including a fairly large sample size including detailed covariates; by using a 93-locus polygenic risk score; and by conducting Mendelian randomisation of BMI on a range of cardiometabolic disease outcomes.

AB  - Importance: Higher body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease; however, the underlying causal associations remain unclear., Objectives: To use UK Biobank data to report causal estimates of the association between BMI and cardiometabolic disease outcomes and traits, such as pulse rate, using mendelian randomization., Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional baseline data from a population-based cohort study including 119859 UK Biobank participants with complete phenotypic (medical and sociodemographic) and genetic data. Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. The present study was conducted from May 1 to July 11, 2016., Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes were determined at assessment, based on self-report. Blood pressure was measured clinically. Participants self-reported sociodemographic information pertaining to relevant confounders. A polygenic risk score comprising 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI from previous genome-wide association studies was constructed, and the genetic risk score was applied to derive causal estimates using a mendelian randomization approach., Results: Of the 119859 individuals included in the study, 56 816 (47.4%) were men; mean (SD) age was 56.87 (7.93) years. Mendelian randomization analysis showed significant positive associations between genetically instrumented higher BMI and risk of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD higher BMI, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.48-1.83; P = 1.1 x 10-19), coronary heart disease (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09-1.69; P = .007) and type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 2.04-3.13; P = 1.5 x 10-17), as well as systolic blood pressure (beta = 1.65 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.78-2.52 mm Hg; P = 2.0 x 10-04) and diastolic blood pressure (beta = 1.37 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.88-1.85 mm Hg; P = 3.6 x 10-08). These associations were independent of age, sex, Townsend deprivation scores, alcohol intake, and smoking history., Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study add to the burgeoning evidence of an association between higher BMI and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. This finding has relevance for public health policies in many countries with increasing obesity levels.

AB  - High serum uric acid (SUA) is known to be associated with an increased risk of adiposity. We examined the causal association of SUA with adiposity markers using SLC2A9 variants as instruments in a Mendelian randomization approach in 2630 men and 2955 women in Lausanne. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7442295 in men and rs7669607 in women) within SLC2A9 gene were used as instrumental variables. Adiposity markers included weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and fat mass. We observed highly significant positive associations between SUA and weight, BMI, waist and fat mass in an ordinary least square regression (? coefficient [95%CI]=3.38 [3.24,4.42], 1.24 [1.04,1.43], 3.65 [3.12,4.18]and 2.19 [1.84,2.54]in men and 6.38 [5.71,7.05], 2.45 [2.19, 2.70],6.38 [5.73, 7.03] and 4.67 [4.17,5.16] in women, respectively, all p<0.001). However, using genetic variants within SLC2A9 in a two-stage least square regression, SUA explained by rs7442295 and rs7669607 was not significantly associated with any adiposity marker (estimates close to zero and often even negative) in both genders. Our findings provide no evidence for a positive causal effect of SUA on adiposity markers. These results are compatible with a possible reverse causality (i.e. elevated adiposity leading to hyperuricemia) or a common cause shared by hyperuricemia and elevated adiposity (e.g. fructose intake) or failure to fulfill the assumptions underlying Mendelian randomization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) and adiposity is well established, the direction of the causality is still unclear in the presence of conflicting evidences. We used a bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach to explore the nature and direction of causality between SUA and adiposity in a population-based study of Caucasians aged 35 to 75 years., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used, as instrumental variables, rs6855911 within the SUA gene SLC2A9 in one direction, and combinations of SNPs within the adiposity genes FTO, MC4R and TMEM18 in the other direction. Adiposity markers included weight, body mass index, waist circumference and fat mass. We applied a two-stage least squares regression: a regression of SUA/adiposity markers on our instruments in the first stage and a regression of the response of interest on the fitted values from the first stage regression in the second stage. SUA explained by the SLC2A9 instrument was not associated to fat mass (regression coefficient [95% confidence interval]: 0.05 [-0.10, 0.19] for fat mass) contrasting with the ordinary least square estimate (0.37 [0.34, 0.40]). By contrast, fat mass explained by genetic variants of the FTO, MC4R and TMEM18 genes was positively and significantly associated to SUA (0.31 [0.01, 0.62]), similar to the ordinary least square estimate (0.27 [0.25, 0.29]). Results were similar for the other adiposity markers., CONCLUSIONS: Using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach in adult Caucasians, our findings suggest that elevated SUA is a consequence rather than a cause of adiposity.

AB  - Apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) has been observed to be associated with lipids, kidney function, adiposity- and diabetes-related parameters. To assess the causal relationship of apoA-IV with these phenotypes, we conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using publicly available summary-level datasets from GWAS consortia on apoA-IV concentrations (n = 13,813), kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), n = 133,413), lipid traits (HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, n = 188,577), adiposity-related traits (body-mass-index (n = 322,206), waist-hip-ratio (n = 210,088)) and fasting glucose (n = 133,010). Main analyses consisted in inverse-variance weighted and multivariable MR, whereas MR-Egger regression and weighted median estimation were used as sensitivity analyses. We found that eGFR is likely to be causal on apoA-IV concentrations (53 SNPs; causal effect estimate per 1-SD increase in eGFR = -0.39; 95% CI = [-0.54, -0.24]; p-value = 2.4e-07). Triglyceride concentrations were also causally associated with apoA-IV concentrations (40 SNPs; causal effect estimate per 1-SD increase in triglycerides = -0.06; 95% CI = [-0.08, -0.04]; p-value = 4.8e-07), independently of HDL-C and LDL-C concentrations (causal effect estimate from multivariable MR = -0.06; 95% CI = [-0.10, -0.02]; p-value = 0.0014). Evaluating the inverse direction of causality revealed a possible causal association of apoA-IV on HDL-cholesterol (2 SNPs; causal effect estimate per one percent increase in apoA-IV = -0.40; 95% CI = [-0.60, -0.21]; p-value = 5.5e-05).

AB  - Epidemiological studies have linked body mass index (BMI) with risk of gastrointestinal cancers. However, for gastric cancer, the relationship is more controversial. In particular, it is unclear whether the observed association is due to confounding or bias inherent in conventional observational studies. To investigate whether BMI is causally associated with gastric cancer risk, we applied Mendelian randomization using individual-level data from 2631 gastric cancer cases and 4373 cancer-free controls. We derived a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) using 37 BMI-associated genetic variants as an instrumental variable. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between genetically predicted BMI and gastric cancer risk. We observed that higher genetically determined BMI was associated with increased gastric cancer risk (per standard deviation (SD) increase in the wGRS: OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.13, P=4.94 x 10-3). Compared with individuals in the bottom tertile of the BMI wGRS, those in the top tertile had 1.14-fold (95% CI: 1.01-1.29) increased risk of developing gastric cancer. Sensitivity analyses using alternative causal inference measures demonstrated consistent association. Our study indicated that genetically high BMI was associated with increased gastric cancer risk, suggesting that high BMI may have a causal role in the etiology of gastric cancer.

AB  - CONTEXT: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, whether each of the 5 components of the MetS individually is causally associated with T2D is unknown., OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that each component is causally associated with T2D., DESIGN: Mendelian randomization using genetic variations that alter levels of the MetS components are randomly assorted at gamete formation and free of confounding and reverse causation, which allows us to infer causality., SETTING: General community., STUDY PARTICIPANTS: A total of 95 756 individuals from the prospective Copenhagen General Population Study., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Type 2 diabetes., RESULTS: A 1-cm larger waist circumference was associated with an observational 5% (95% confidence interval, 4%-5%) and a causal genetic 5% (1%-10%) higher risk of T2D. In contrast, although a 1-unit higher level of triglycerides and blood pressure and a 1-unit lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with higher observational T2D risk, the corresponding causal genetic risks were not. As expected, a 1 mmol/L higher glucose level was associated with an observational 32% (30%-34%) and a causal genetic 82% (21%-173%) higher T2D risk., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, larger waist circumference and higher glucose levels were each causally associated with higher risk of T2D. Findings like these may change clinical thinking so that waist circumference control will be prioritized to the same extend as control of blood pressure, lipids, and glucose levels in T2D prevention.

AB  - Context: Obesity, glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), and insulin secretion (HOMA2-beta) are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) observationally. However, the causal, genetic contribution of each parameter to this risk is largely unknown and important to study since observational data are prone to confounding whereas genetic, causal data are free of confounding and reverse causation., Objective: We examined the causal, genetic contribution of body mass index (BMI), glucose level, C-peptide level, HOMA2-IR, and HOMA2-beta to risk of T2D in 95,540 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study and estimated absolute 10-year risks., Methods: Cox regression analysis, instrumental variable analysis and Poisson regression analysis were performed to estimate observational hazard ratios, causal, genetic odds ratios, and absolute 10-year risks of T2D., Results: For a 1 standard deviation higher level, BMI was associated with an observational 66% (62%-72%) and a causal, genetic 121% (25%-291%) higher risk of T2D; glucose with an observational 44% (41%-46%) and a causal, genetic 183% (56%-416%) higher risk of T2D; and HOMA2-IR with an observational 30% (18%-44%) and a causal, genetic 12% (2%-22%) higher risk of T2D. Conversely, for a 1 standard deviation higher level, HOMA2-beta was associated with an observational 14% (11%-16%) and a causal, genetic 21% (8%-32%) lower risk of T2D. Upper tertiles of HOMA2-IR were associated with absolute 10-year diabetes risks of 31% and 37% in obese women and men, older than 60 years of age and with a glucose level between 6.1-11.0 mmol/L., Conclusions: BMI, glucose level, HOMA2-IR and HOMA2-beta are causally associated with T2D.

AB  - Background: Prior observational research established that adiposity is associated with anxiety, but the size and direction of effects remain controversial. Recent genetic instrumental variable (IV) analyses investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and common mental disorders and depression, but did not address anxiety specifically. Methods: Data are from 10907 (whites = 9627, blacks = 1276) participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative cohort of US adults aged 50+ , with genetic data and 5 items from the Beck Anxiety Inventory. FTO and a genetic risk score (GRS), calculated as sum of 32 risk alleles multiplied by the per allele effect size on BMI (based on prior publications), were used as IVs. Self-reported BMI prior to the anxiety assessment was used to confirm that FTO and the GRS predicted BMI in HRS. We used separate-sample Iinear IV regression to investigate the causal effect of BMI on the anxiety score. Mechanism-specific GRS (e.g., adiposity, appetite, and cardio-pulmonary factors) were used for overidentification tests. Results: FTO and GRS explained between 0.3% and 1.5% of the variance in BMI in blacks and whites. In observational analyses, higher BMI predicted higher anxiety (whites, beta per unit of BMI = 0.007, 95%-CI: 0.004, 0.009; blacks: beta = 0.007, CI: 0.001, 0.013). The IV estimates based on FTO (white: 0.005, CI: -0.036, 0.047; blacks: 0.205, CI: -0.014, 0.423) and GRS (whites: -0.002, CI: -0.024, 0.019; blacks: 0.006, CI: -0.078, 0.090) were non-significant and close to the null. The over-identification test using mechanism specific GRS was rejected in blacks (p = 0.028) but not whites (p = 0.291) Conclusions: This IV analysis does not support a causal effect of BMI on anxiety. The rejected over-identification test in blacks may suggest that BMI is a heterogeneous phenotype with questionable causal interpretation or the existence of a common genetic determinant of BMI and anxiety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The link between DNA methylation, obesity, and adiposity-related diseases in the general population remains uncertain., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted an association study of body mass index (BMI) and differential methylation for over 400,000 CpGs assayed by microarray in whole-blood-derived DNA from 3,743 participants in the Framingham Heart Study and the Lothian Birth Cohorts, with independent replication in three external cohorts of 4,055 participants. We examined variations in whole blood gene expression and conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to investigate the functional and clinical relevance of the findings. We identified novel and previously reported BMI-related differential methylation at 83 CpGs that replicated across cohorts; BMI-related differential methylation was associated with concurrent changes in the expression of genes in lipid metabolism pathways. Genetic instrumental variable analysis of alterations in methylation at one of the 83 replicated CpGs, cg11024682 (intronic to sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 [SREBF1]), demonstrated links to BMI, adiposity-related traits, and coronary artery disease. Independent genetic instruments for expression of SREBF1 supported the findings linking methylation to adiposity and cardiometabolic disease. Methylation at a substantial proportion (16 of 83) of the identified loci was found to be secondary to differences in BMI. However, the cross-sectional nature of the data limits definitive causal determination., CONCLUSIONS: We present robust associations of BMI with differential DNA methylation at numerous loci in blood cells. BMI-related DNA methylation and gene expression provide mechanistic insights into the relationship between DNA methylation, obesity, and adiposity-related diseases.

AB  - Observational cohort studies can provide rich datasets with a diverse range of phenotypic variables. However, hypothesis-driven epidemiological analyses by definition only test particular hypotheses chosen by researchers. Furthermore, observational analyses may not provide robust evidence of causality, as they are susceptible to confounding, reverse causation and measurement error. Using body mass index (BMI) as an exemplar, we demonstrate a novel extension to the phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) approach, using automated screening with genotypic instruments to screen for causal associations amongst any number of phenotypic outcomes. We used a sample of 8,121 children from the ALSPAC dataset, and tested the linear association of a BMI-associated allele score with 172 phenotypic outcomes (with variable sample sizes). We also performed an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of BMI on each phenotype. We found 21 of the 172 outcomes were associated with the allele score at an unadjusted p<0.05 threshold, and use Bonferroni corrections, permutation testing and estimates of the false discovery rate to consider the strength of results given the number of tests performed. The most strongly associated outcomes included leptin, lipid profile, and blood pressure. We also found novel evidence of effects of BMI on a global self-worth score.

AB  - Mendelian randomization (MR) has been used to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on particular traits thought to be affected by BMI. However, BMI may also be a modifiable, causal risk factor for outcomes where there is no prior reason to suggest that a causal effect exists. We performed a MR phenome-wide association study (MR-pheWAS) to search for the causal effects of BMI in UK Biobank (n = 334 968), using the PHESANT open-source phenome scan tool. A subset of identified associations were followed up with a formal two-stage instrumental variable analysis in UK Biobank, to estimate the causal effect of BMI on these phenotypes. Of the 22 922 tests performed, our MR-pheWAS identified 587 associations below a stringent P value threshold corresponding to a 5% estimated false discovery rate. These included many previously identified causal effects, for instance, an adverse effect of higher BMI on risk of diabetes and hypertension. We also identified several novel effects, including protective effects of higher BMI on a set of psychosocial traits, identified initially in our preliminary MR-pheWAS in circa 115,000 UK Biobank participants and replicated in a different subset of circa 223,000 UK Biobank participants. Our comprehensive MR-pheWAS identified potential causal effects of BMI on a large and diverse set of phenotypes. This included both previously identified causal effects, and novel effects such as a protective effect of higher BMI on feelings of nervousness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have reported an association between obesity, as measured by elevated body mass index (BMI), in early adulthood and risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, bias potentially introduced by confounding and reverse causation may have influenced these findings. Therefore, we elected to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to evaluate whether genetically increased BMI is associated with an increased risk of MS., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Employing a two-sample MR approach, we used summary statistics from the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and the International MS Genetics Consortium (IMSGC), the largest genome-wide association studies for BMI and MS, respectively (GIANT: n = 322,105; IMSGC: n = 14,498 cases and 24,091 controls). Seventy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genome-wide significant (p < 5 x 10-8) for BMI in GIANT (n = 322,105) and were investigated for their association with MS risk in the IMSGC. The effect of each SNP on MS was weighted by its effect on BMI, and estimates were pooled to provide a summary measure for the effect of increased BMI upon risk of MS. Our results suggest that increased BMI influences MS susceptibility, where a 1 standard deviation increase in genetically determined BMI (kg/m2) increased odds of MS by 41% (odds ratio [OR]: 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.66, p = 2.7 x 10-5, I2 = 0%, 95% CI 0-29). Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression, and the weighted median approach provided no evidence of pleiotropic effects. The main study limitations are that, while these sensitivity analyses reduce the possibility that pleiotropy influenced our results, residual pleiotropy is difficult to exclude entirely., CONCLUSION: Genetically elevated BMI is associated with risk of MS, providing evidence for a causal role for obesity in MS etiology. While obesity has been associated with many late-life outcomes, these findings suggest an important consequence of childhood and/or early adulthood obesity.

AB  - Observational research shows that higher body mass index (BMI) increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but it is unclear whether this association is causal. We applied genetic variants that predict BMI in Mendelian randomization analyses, an approach that is not biased by reverse causation or confounding, to evaluate whether higher BMI increases AD risk. We evaluated individual-level data from the AD Genetics Consortium (ADGC: 10,079 AD cases and 9613 controls), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS: 8403 participants with algorithm-predicted dementia status), and published associations from the Genetic and Environmental Risk for AD consortium (GERAD1: 3177 AD cases and 7277 controls). No evidence from individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms or polygenic scores indicated BMI increased AD risk. Mendelian randomization effect estimates per BMI point (95% confidence intervals) were as follows: ADGC, odds ratio (OR) = 0.95 (0.90-1.01); HRS, OR = 1.00 (0.75-1.32); GERAD1, OR = 0.96 (0.87-1.07). One subscore (cellular processes not otherwise specified) unexpectedly predicted lower AD risk. Copyright © 2015 The Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To infer the causal association between childhood BMI and age at menarche, we performed a mendelian randomisation analysis using twelve established "BMI-increasing" genetic variants as an instrumental variable (IV) for higher BMI. In 8,156 women of European descent from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, height was measured at age 39-77 years; age at menarche was self-recalled, as was body weight at age 20 years, and BMI at 20 was calculated as a proxy for childhood BMI. DNA was genotyped for twelve BMI-associated common variants (in/near FTO, MC4R, TMEM18, GNPDA2, KCTD15, NEGR1, BDNF, ETV5, MTCH2, SEC16B, FAIM2 and SH2B1), and for each individual a "BMI-increasing-allele-score" was calculated by summing the number of BMI-increasing alleles across all 12 loci. Using this BMI-increasing-allele-score as an instrumental variable for BMI, each 1 kg/m(2) increase in childhood BMI was predicted to result in a 6.5% (95% CI: 4.6-8.5%) higher absolute risk of early menarche (before age 12 years). While mendelian randomisation analysis is dependent on a number of assumptions, our findings support a causal effect of BMI on early menarche and suggests that increasing prevalence of childhood obesity will lead to similar trends in the prevalence of early menarche.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulinemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been associated with endometrial cancer risk in numerous observational studies. However, the causality of these associations is uncertain. Here we use a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess whether insulinemia and T2D are causally associated with endometrial cancer., METHODS: We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with T2D (49 variants), fasting glucose (36 variants), fasting insulin (18 variants), early insulin secretion (17 variants), and body mass index (BMI) (32 variants) as instrumental variables in MR analyses. We calculated MR estimates for each risk factor with endometrial cancer using an inverse-variance weighted method with SNP-endometrial cancer associations from 1287 case patients and 8273 control participants., RESULTS: Genetically predicted higher fasting insulin levels were associated with greater risk of endometrial cancer (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation = 2.34, 95% confidence internal [CI] = 1.06 to 5.14, P = .03). Consistently, genetically predicted higher 30-minute postchallenge insulin levels were also associated with endometrial cancer risk (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.76, P = .003). We observed no associations between genetic risk of type 2 diabetes (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.04, P = .16) or higher fasting glucose (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.50, P = .99) and endometrial cancer. In contrast, endometrial cancer risk was higher in individuals with genetically predicted higher BMI (OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 2.24 to 6.64, P = 1.2x10(-6))., CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence to support a causal association of higher insulin levels, independently of BMI, with endometrial cancer risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiposity, assessed as elevated body mass index (BMI), is associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD); however, whether this is causal is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that positive observational associations between BMI and IHD are causal., METHODS AND FINDINGS: In 75,627 individuals taken from two population-based and one case-control study in Copenhagen, we measured BMI, ascertained 11,056 IHD events, and genotyped FTO(rs9939609), MC4R(rs17782313), and TMEM18(rs6548238). Using genotypes as a combined allele score in instrumental variable analyses, the causal odds ratio (OR) between BMI and IHD was estimated and compared with observational estimates. The allele score-BMI and the allele score-IHD associations used to estimate the causal OR were also calculated individually. In observational analyses the OR for IHD was 1.26 (95% CI 1.19-1.34) for every 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. A one-unit allele score increase associated with a 0.28 kg/m(2) (95 CI% 0.20-0.36) increase in BMI and an OR for IHD of 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05) (corresponding to an average 1.68 kg/m(2) BMI increase and 18% increase in the odds of IHD for those carrying all six BMI increasing alleles). In instrumental variable analysis using the same allele score the causal IHD OR for a 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was 1.52 (95% CI 1.12-2.05)., CONCLUSIONS: For every 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, observational estimates suggested a 26% increase in odds for IHD while causal estimates suggested a 52% increase. These data add evidence to support a causal link between increased BMI and IHD risk, though the mechanism may ultimately be through intermediate factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. This work has important policy implications for public health, given the continuous nature of the BMI-IHD association and the modifiable nature of BMI. This analysis demonstrates the value of observational studies and their ability to provide unbiased results through inclusion of genetic data avoiding confounding, reverse causation, and bias.

AB  - Context: Recently, data on 2,000,000 people established that low body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased risk of dementia. Whether this observational association reflects a causal effect remains to be clarified., Objective: We tested the hypothesis that there is a causal association between low BMI and high risk of Alzheimer's disease., Design, Setting, and Participants: Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we studied 95,578 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) with up to 36 years of follow-up and consortia data on 303,958 individuals from the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP)., Main Outcome Measure: Risk of Alzheimer's disease., Results: The causal odds ratio for a 1-kg/m2 genetically determined lower BMI was 0.98 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77 to 1.23] for a weighted allele score in the CGPS. Using 32 BMI-decreasing variants from GIANT and IGAP the causal odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease for a 1-standard deviation (SD) lower genetically determined BMI was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.22). Corresponding observational hazard ratios from the CGPS were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.09) and 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.46) for a 1-kg/m2 and a 1-SD lower BMI, respectively., Conclusions: Genetic and hence lifelong low BMI is not associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in the general population. These data suggest that low BMI is not a causal risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and that the corresponding observational association likely is explained by reverse causation or confounding.

AB  - Background: We tested the hypothesis that known positive observational relationships between body mass index (BMI) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) are causal. Methods: In two general population studies (the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS; n = 54613 [3780 IHD]) and the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS; n = 10474 [2006 IHD]) we measured BMI and genotyped FTO (rs9939609), MC4R (rs17782313), and TMEM18 (rs6548238). We also genotyped the Copenhagen Ischaemic Heart Disease Study (CIHDS; n = 10540 [5270 IHD]). An allele score across the three genotypes was an instrumental variable for BMI. In all studies, IHD was diagnosed from 1976 though 2009, and follow-up was 100% complete. Results: In the general population, for a 4kg/m2 increase in BMI the observational odds ratios for IHD were 1.23 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.28) for the CGPS, 1.31 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.39) for the CCHS, and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.34) for these studies combined. Each additional adiposity related allele from the allele score was associated with a 0.07 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.09) increase in standardised BMI and an odds ratio for IHD of 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05). Instrumental variable analysis using the allele score estimated causal IHD odds ratios for a 4kg/m2 increase in BMI of 1.31 (95% CI: 0.76, 2.26) in the CGPS, 2.11 (95% CI: 1.05, 4.24) in the CCHS, 1.46 (95% CI: 0.96, 2.24) in the CIHDS, and 1.52 (95% CI: 1.12, 2.05) for these studies combined. Conclusions: For every 4kg/m2 increase in BMI, observational estimates suggested a 26% increase in risk of IHD. Causal estimates derived using genotypes reliably associated with BMI are largely free of confounding and reverse causation. These suggest that a 4kg/m2 BMI increase confers a 52% increase in risk of IHD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The interactive effect of two exposures on an outcome can be confounded. We demonstrate the use of Mendelian Randomization (MR) to estimate unconfounded additive interactions. METHODS: Using simulation, we test an extension to multivariable MR using two-stage least squares to estimate the additive interaction between two continuous exposures on a continuous outcome, including scenarios where one exposure has a causal effect on the other (mediation). The interaction parameters were set to be one third of the main effect parameters to impose a limit on the variance explained by interaction terms. We compare the performance of the two-stage least squares estimator to a Factorial MR design, in which genetic risk scores for each exposure are dichotomised to create four groups, akin to a factorial randomized controlled trial. As an illustrative example, we apply factorial MR and the 2SLS estimator to the interactive effect of education and BMI on systolic blood pressure in UK Biobank. RESULTS: Our simulations demonstrate that factorial MR has very low statistical power; 5-7% at N=50,000 and 8-23% at N=500,000 across the range of parameters tested. The two-stage least squares estimator had higher power to detect interactions than factorial MR and a lower type I error. For N=500,000, the two-stage least squares estimator had a power ranging from 29.7-92.9% and a type I error ranging from 4-6%. 95% Monte Carlo confidence intervals suggested that the estimator was unbiased to a reasonable degree of accuracy at this sample size. In comparison, the power at N=50,000 was 7-55%. CONCLUSIONS: A two-stage least squares estimator using genetic risk scores for each exposure is a more powerful alternative for detecting an unconfounded additive interaction of two exposures on an outcome than existing approaches that rely on dichotomising genetic risk scores, but it requires a large sample size and instruments of adequate strength.

AB  - Objective: To use two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) to study the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on Parkinson's disease (PD). Background: Both positive and negative associations between BMI and PD have been reported in observational studies, but it has been difficult to establish causality because of the possibility of residual confounding or reverse causation. To our knowledge, MR, the use of genetic instrumental variables to explore causal effects, has not previously been used to test the effect of BMI on PD. Methods: Two-sample MR was undertaken using genome-wide association study data. The associations between the genetic instruments and BMI were obtained from the GIANT consortium (1) and consisted of the per-allele difference in mean BMI for 77 independent variants that reached genome-wide significance. The per-allele difference in log-odds of PD for each of these variants was estimated from a recent meta-analysis (2), which included 13,708 cases of PD and 95,282 controls. The inverse variance weighted method was used to estimate a pooled odds ratio (OR) for the effect of a 5kg/m2 increase in BMI on PD. Evidence of directional pleiotropy averaged across all variants was sought using MR-Egger regression. Frailty simulations were used to assess whether causal associations were affected by mortality selection. Results: A genetically related 5kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a reduced risk of PD (OR 0 82, 95% CI 0 69-0 98). MR-Egger regression gave similar results (OR 0 76, 95% CI 0 51-1 14), providing evidence against directional pleiotropy (intercept 0 002, p-value=0 654). Frailty analysis indicated that the observed negative association between BMI and PD may have been biased by a negative association between BMI and survival, but this did not fully explain the estimated causal effect. Conclusions: In this large study using two-sample MR, we found evidence to suggest that increased BMI may be protective against risk of PD. The mechanism underlying this protective effect warrants further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both positive and negative associations between higher body mass index (BMI) and Parkinson disease (PD) have been reported in observational studies, but it has been difficult to establish causality because of the possibility of residual confounding or reverse causation. To our knowledge, Mendelian randomisation (MR)-the use of genetic instrumental variables (IVs) to explore causal effects-has not previously been used to test the effect of BMI on PD., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two-sample MR was undertaken using genome-wide association (GWA) study data. The associations between the genetic instruments and BMI were obtained from the GIANT consortium and consisted of the per-allele difference in mean BMI for 77 independent variants that reached genome-wide significance. The per-allele difference in log-odds of PD for each of these variants was estimated from a recent meta-analysis, which included 13,708 cases of PD and 95,282 controls. The inverse-variance weighted method was used to estimate a pooled odds ratio (OR) for the effect of a 5-kg/m2 higher BMI on PD. Evidence of directional pleiotropy averaged across all variants was sought using MR-Egger regression. Frailty simulations were used to assess whether causal associations were affected by mortality selection. A combined genetic IV expected to confer a lifetime exposure of 5-kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a lower risk of PD (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.98). MR-Egger regression gave similar results, suggesting that directional pleiotropy was unlikely to be biasing the result (intercept 0.002; p = 0.654). However, the apparent protective influence of higher BMI could be at least partially induced by survival bias in the PD GWA study, as demonstrated by frailty simulations. Other important limitations of this application of MR include the inability to analyse non-linear associations, to undertake subgroup analyses, and to gain mechanistic insights., CONCLUSIONS: In this large study using two-sample MR, we found that variants known to influence BMI had effects on PD in a manner consistent with higher BMI leading to lower risk of PD. The mechanism underlying this apparent protective effect warrants further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Serum uric acid (SUA) is a suggested biomarker for established coronary artery disease, but the role of SUA in early phases of atherosclerosis is controversial. The relations of SUA with vascular markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, including carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT), carotid plaque, carotid distensibility (Cdist) and brachial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) were examined in 1985 young adults aged 30-45 years. In addition to ordinary regression, we used Mendelian randomization techniques to infer causal associations., RESULTS: In women, the independent multivariate correlates of SUA included BMI, creatinine, alcohol use, triglycerides, glucose and adiponectin (inverse association) (Model R(2) = 0.30). In men, the correlates were BMI, creatinine, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, alcohol use, total cholesterol and adiponectin (inverse) (Model R(2) = 0.33). BMI alone explained most of the variation of SUA levels both in women and men (Partial R(2) ~ 0.2). When SUA was modeled as an explanatory variable for vascular markers, it directly associated with cIMT and inversely with Cdist in age- and sex-adjusted analysis. After further adjustments for BMI or glomerular filtration rate, these relations were reduced to non-significance. No associations were found between SUA and FMD or the presence of a carotid plaque. Mendelian randomization analyses using known genetic variants for BMI and SUA confirmed that BMI is causally linked to SUA and that BMI is a significant confounder in the association between SUA and cIMT., CONCLUSION: SUA is associated with cardiovascular risk markers in young adults, especially BMI, but we found no evidence that SUA would have an independent role in the pathophysiology of early atherosclerosis.

AB  - Background: Potentially modifiable risk factors including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking are associated with Alzheimer Disease (AD) and represent promising targets for intervention. However, the causality of these associations is unclear. We sought to assess the causal nature of these associations using Mendelian Randomization'(MR). Methods: We used SNPs associated with each risk factor as instrumental variables in MR analyses. We considered type 2'diabetes (T2D, nSNPs = 49), fasting glucose (nSNPs = 36), insulin resistance (nSNPs = 10), body mass index (BMI, nSNPs = 32), total cholesterol (nSNPs = 73), HDL-cholesterol (nSNPs = 71), LDL-cholesterol (nSNPs = 57), triglycerides (nSNPs = 39), systolic blood pressure (SBP, nSNPs = 24), smoking initiation (nSNPs = 1), smoking quantity (nSNPs = 3), university completion (nSNPs = 2), and years of education (nSNPs = 1). We calculated MR estimates of associations between each exposure and AD risk using an inverse-variance weighted approach, with summary statistics of SNP-AD associations from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, comprising a total of 17,008 individuals with AD and 37,154 cognitively normal elderly controls. Results: We found that genetically predicted higher SBP was associated with lower AD risk (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [15.4 mm Hg] of SBP [95% CI]: 0.75 [0.62-0.91]; p = 3.4 x 10-3). Genetically predicted higher SBP was also associated with a higher probability of taking antihypertensive medication (p = 6.7 x 10-8). Genetically predicted smoking quantity was associated with lower AD risk (OR per ten cigarettes per day [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.51-0.89]; p = 6.5 x 10-3), although we were unable to stratify by smoking history; genetically predicted smoking initiation was not associated with AD risk (OR = 0.70 [0.37, 1.33]; p = 0.28). We saw no evidence of causal associations between glycemic traits, T2D, BMI, or educational attainment and risk of AD (all p >'0.1). Discussion: Inherited lifetime exposure to higher SBP is associated with lower AD risk. These findings suggest that higher blood pressure- or some environmental exposure associated with higher blood pressure, such as use of antihypertensive medications-may reduce AD risk. Potential limitations of this study include the small proportion of intermediate trait variance explained by genetic variants and other implicit limitations of MR analyses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The strongest known risk factor for endometrial cancer is obesity. To determine whether SNPs associated with increased body mass index (BMI) or waist-hip ratio (WHR) are associated with endometrial cancer risk, independent of measured BMI, we investigated relationships between 77 BMI and 47 WHR SNPs and endometrial cancer in 6,609 cases and 37,926 country-matched controls., METHODS: Logistic regression analysis and fixed effects meta-analysis were used to test for associations between endometrial cancer risk and (i) individual BMI or WHR SNPs, (ii) a combined weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) for BMI or WHR. Causality of BMI for endometrial cancer was assessed using Mendelian randomization, with BMIwGRS as instrumental variable., RESULTS: The BMIwGRS was significantly associated with endometrial cancer risk (P = 3.4 x 10-17). Scaling the effect of the BMIwGRS on endometrial cancer risk by its effect on BMI, the endometrial cancer OR per 5 kg/m2 of genetically predicted BMI was 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.89-2.21], larger than the observed effect of BMI on endometrial cancer risk (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.44-1.68, per 5 kg/m2). The association attenuated but remained significant after adjusting for BMI (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10-1.39; P = 5.3 x 10-4). There was evidence of directional pleiotropy (P = 1.5 x 10-4). BMI SNP rs2075650 was associated with endometrial cancer at study-wide significance (P < 4.0 x 10-4), independent of BMI. Endometrial cancer was not significantly associated with individual WHR SNPs or the WHRwGRS., CONCLUSIONS: BMI, but not WHR, is causally associated with endometrial cancer risk, with evidence that some BMI-associated SNPs alter endometrial cancer risk via mechanisms other than measurable BMI., IMPACT: The causal association between BMI SNPs and endometrial cancer has possible implications for endometrial cancer risk modeling.

AB  - Monogenic obesity disorders and mouse models of obesity have overwhelmingly pointed to hyperphagia as the predominant genetic force in promoting obesity, it was therefore no surprise when the most robust common variant associated with obesity from GWAS studies was associated with increased energy intake. We and other groups have shown that variants in the FTO gene are not associated with increased food intake per se, but rather display a preference for energy dense foods resulting in an increased calorific intake. This leads to an increase in BMI that is readily detectable in children as young as four years of age. This increase in BMI is largely due to an increase in whole body fat mass, and specific fat depots are not selectively involved in this phenotype. Mice deleted for the FTO locus display hyperphagia, however increased metabolism leads to a leaner phenotype, whereas in the humans increased metabolism is also observed in the hyperphagic minor allele carriers, but this is clearly not sufficient to prevent obesity in these individuals. This increased BMI from early childhood to adulthood leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and finally results in premature death through cardiovascular disease. These observations represent a clear mendelian randomisation experiment confirming the powerful causal role of poor dietary habits and obesity in driving premature morbidity and mortality being observed in many populations around the world.

AB  - Mendelian randomisation analyses use genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to estimate causal effects of modifiable risk factors on disease outcomes. Genetic variants typically explain a small proportion of the variability in risk factors; hence Mendelian randomisation analyses can require large sample sizes. However, an increasing number of genetic variants have been found to be robustly associated with disease-related outcomes in genome-wide association studies. Use of multiple instruments can improve the precision of IV estimates, and also permit examination of underlying IV assumptions. We discuss the use of multiple genetic variants in Mendelian randomisation analyses with continuous outcome variables where all relationships are assumed to be linear. We describe possible violations of IV assumptions, and how multiple instrument analyses can be used to identify them. We present an example using four adiposity-associated genetic variants as IVs for the causal effect of fat mass on bone density, using data on 5509 children enrolled in the ALSPAC birth cohort study. We also use simulation studies to examine the effect of different sets of IVs on precision and bias. When each instrument independently explains variability in the risk factor, use of multiple instruments increases the precision of IV estimates. However, inclusion of weak instruments could increase finite sample bias. Missing data on multiple genetic variants can diminish the available sample size, compared with single instrument analyses. In simulations with additive genotype-risk factor effects, IV estimates using a weighted allele score had similar properties to estimates using multiple instruments. Under the correct conditions, multiple instrument analyses are a promising approach for Mendelian randomisation studies. Further research is required into multiple imputation methods to address missing data issues in IV estimation.

However, when using genotypic instruments for uric acid and hyperuricaemia, we saw no evidence for causal associations between uric acid, ischaemic heart disease, and blood pressure. We used genetic instruments to investigate body mass index as a potentially confounding factor in observational associations, and saw a causal effect on uric acid levels. Every four unit increase of body mass index saw a rise in uric acid of 0.03 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.04), and an increase in risk of hyperuricaemia of 7.5% (3.9% to 11.1%)., CONCLUSION: By contrast with observational findings, there is no strong evidence for causal associations between uric acid and ischaemic heart disease or blood pressure. However, evidence supports a causal effect between body mass index and uric acid level and hyperuricaemia. This finding strongly suggests body mass index as a confounder in observational associations, and suggests a role for elevated body mass index or obesity in the development of uric acid related conditions.

AB  - In this paper, the authors describe different instrumental variable (IV) estimators of causal risk ratios and odds ratios with particular attention to methods that can handle continuously measured exposures. The authors present this discussion in the context of a Mendelian randomization analysis of the effect of body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) on the risk of asthma at age 7 years (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, 1991-1992). The authors show that the multiplicative structural mean model (MSMM) and the multiplicative generalized method of moments (MGMM) estimator produce identical estimates of the causal risk ratio. In the example, MSMM and MGMM estimates suggested an inverse relation between BMI and asthma but other IV estimates suggested a positive relation, although all estimates had wide confidence intervals. An interaction between the associations of BMI and fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype with asthma explained the different directions of the different estimates, and a simulation study supported the observation that MSMM/MGMM estimators are negatively correlated with the other estimators when such an interaction is present. The authors conclude that point estimates from various IV methods can differ in practical applications. Based on the theoretical properties of the estimators, structural mean models make weaker assumptions than other IV estimators and can therefore be expected to be consistent in a wider range of situations.

AB  - Objective: Variation in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene influences susceptibility to obesity. A variant in the FTO gene has been implicated in genetic risk to osteoarthritis (OA). We examined the role of the FTO polymorphism rs8044769 in risk of knee and hip OA in cases and controls incorporating body mass index (BMI) information. Methods: 5409 knee OA patients, 4355 hip OA patients and up to 5362 healthy controls from 7 independent cohorts from the UK and Australia were genotyped for rs8044769. The association of the FTO variant with OA was investigated in case/control analyses with and without BMI adjustment and in analyses matched for BMI category. A mendelian randomisation approach was employed using the FTO variant as the instrumental variable to evaluate the role of overweight on OA. Results: In the meta-analysis of all overweight (BMI>=25) samples versus normal-weight controls irrespective of OA status the association of rs8044769 with overweight is highly significant (OR[CIs] for allele G=1.14 [01.08 to 1.19], p=7.5x10-7). A significant association with knee OA is present in the analysis without BMI adjustment (OR[CIs]=1.08[1.02 to 1.14], p=0.009) but the signal fully attenuates after BMI adjustment (OR[CIs]=0.99[0.93 to 1.05], p=0.666). We observe no evidence for association in the BMI-matched meta-analyses. Using mendelian randomisation approaches we confirm the causal role of overweight on OA. Conclusions: Our data highlight the contribution of genetic risk to overweight in defining risk to OA but the association is exclusively mediated by the effect on BMI. This is consistent with what is known of the biology of the FTO gene and supports the causative role of high BMI in OA. © 2013 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd & European League Against Rheumatism.

AB  - Introduction Previous observational studies investigating height, body mass index and serum lipid levels as prognostic factors in ovarian cancer have been inconclusive. In addition to possible influences of reverse causation, it is possible that factors such as diet, socio-economic status and other lifestyle factors are confounding true associations. Mendelian Randomization (MR) utilises genotype data for variants associated with phenotypes of interest to create genetic risk scores for these modifiable exposures. One advantage of using genetic markers as proxies is that they are determined from birth and are therefore unaffected by confounding variables. We aim to use MR to investigate the association between height, BMI and serum lipid levels (high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides) and ovarian cancer prognosis in the absence of confounding variables. Methods We used data from 12,908 invasive ovarian cancer cases with 5,813 events from 26 studies in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. All individuals were of European ancestry. We calculated genetic risk scores for each individual for height, BMI and serum lipids by taking the sum of the alleles associated with the trait, weighted by the size of their effect on the trait. The genetic risk scores were then included in a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for study and two principal components to test for association with prognosis. For the analysis of height, we included 422 uncorrelated single nucleotide polymorphisms identified by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium as associated with height at genome-wide significance. In the analysis of BMI, we included 32 SNPs associated with BMI in analyses by the GIANT consortium. In order to account for the pleiotropy between the three lipid types we included the genetic risk scores for each of the three traits in a joint analysis. SNPs identified by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium as associated with lipid levels were included: 95 with HDL, 82 with LDL and 64 with triglycerides. Results We found no evidence of association between the five genetic risk scores and ovarian cancer prognosis. The genetic risk score for height had an estimated hazard ratio of 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.94 - 1.08, p-value = 0.82. The hazard ratio for BMI was 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 - 1.05, p-value = 0.99. The hazard ratios for HDL, LDL and triglycerides were 1.03(0.94-1.13), 1.02(0.94-1.12) and 1.08(0.96-1.21) respectively with p-values = 0.53, 0.58 and 0.19. Conclusion Our study does not provide any evidence of association between height, BMI and serum lipid levels and ovarian cancer prognosis.

AB  - Background: The nature and underlying mechanisms of the observed increased vulnerability to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women are unclear. Methods: We investigated the genetic overlap of PTSD with anthropometric traits and reproductive behaviors and functions in women. The analysis was conducted using female-specific summary statistics from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a cohort of 3577 European American women (966 PTSD cases and 2611 trauma-exposed controls). We applied a high-resolution polygenic score approach and Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate genetic correlations and causal relationships. Results: We observed an inverse association of PTSD with genetically determined anthropometric traits related to body shape, independent of body mass index (BMI). The top association was related to BMI-adjusted waist circumference (WCadj; R = -0.079, P < 0.001, Q = 0.011). We estimated a relative decrease of 64.6% (95% confidence interval = 27.5-82.7) in the risk of PTSD per 1-SD increase in WCadj. MR-Egger regression intercept analysis showed no evidence of pleiotropic effects in this association (Ppleiotropy = 0.979). We also observed associations of genetically determined WCadj with age at first sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners (P = 0.013 and P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: There is a putative causal relationship between genetically determined female body shape and PTSD, which could be mediated by evolutionary mechanisms involved in human sexual behaviors.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Childhood obesity is a strong predictor of adult obesity. Body mass index (BMI) has been associated with a dose-response increase in risk of osteoarthritis. However, studying causality in this association is difficult due to confounding factors Objectives: To study the causal association of childhood and adult BMI on the risk of developing osteoarthritis using Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods Methods: A two-step MR analysis was conducted. Exposures were determined by reviewing data from two genome-wide association study (GWAS) from >47,000 children describing 15 SNPs associated with childhood BMI, and another GWAS describing 97 SNPs related to BMI within 3 39 224 adults. For the outcomes, data gathered from a GWAS analysing 3 37 000 unrelated individuals in the UK BioBank was used to assess the association between the SNPs of interest and self-reported osteoarthritis and ICD10 linked hospital data: knee, hip and first carpo-metacarpal joint osteoarthritis. Traumatic eye injury from the same cohort was used as a negative control. An inverse variance weighted meta-analysis estimator was used to test for association. In presence of heterogeneity, a weighted median approach was used and, when necessary, pleiotropy was controlled for using the MR Egger method. All analyses were performed using the TwoSampleMR package in R Results: 14 and 91 SNPs associated with BMI in the childhood and adulthood were identified in the UK BioBank GWAS respectively. Association between childhood BMI and adult OA was seen for self-reported and hip and knee OA. Adult BMI also appeared associated with them [figure 1]. Conversely, no associations were found between BMI (either childhood or adult) and Hand OA risk. Finally, no relationship was seen between BMI and traumatic eye injury (negative control) Conclusions: Higher BMI in both childhood and adulthood overweight/obesity cause an excess in risk of knee and hip osteoarthritis. Whilst the effect of adult BMI seems stronger on knees, childhood BMI might impact both knee and hip osteoarthritis risk similarly. Age-specific associations should be treated with caution given significant overlap between loci associated with BMI across age ranges. In contrast, our findings contradict previous cohorts that found an association between overweight/obesity and hand osteoarthritis, which could be explained by confounding factors such as manual work or related socio-economic factors. The association between increased BMI and knee or hip osteoarthritis adds further impetus to strategies for the prevention of childhood and adult obesity in order to reduce subsequent disability.

AB  - One in four adults worldwide are either overweight or obese. Epidemiological studies indicate that the location and distribution of excess fat, rather than general adiposity, is most informative for predicting risk of obesity sequellae, including cardiometabolic disease and cancer. We performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of body fat distribution, measured by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), and identified 463 signals in 346 loci. Heritability and variant effects were generally stronger in women than men, and we found approximately one-third of all signals to be sexually dimorphic. The 5% of individuals carrying the most WHRadjBMI-increasing alleles were 1.62 times more likely than the bottom 5% to have a WHR above the thresholds used for metabolic syndrome. These data, made publicly available, will inform the biology of body fat distribution and its relationship with disease.

AB  - We propose a novel method for robust estimation of causal effects in two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using potentially large number of genetic instruments. We consider a "working model" for bi-variate effect-size distribution across pairs of traits in the form of normal-mixtures which assumes existence of a fraction of the genetic markers that are valid instruments, i.e. they have only direct effect on one trait, while other markers can have potentially correlated, direct and indirect effects, or have no effects at all. We show that model motivates a simple method for estimating causal effect (

AB  - Background: BRCA1/2 mutations confer high lifetime risk of breast cancer, although other factors may modify this risk. Whether height or body mass index (BMI) modifies breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers remains unclear., Methods: We used Mendelian randomization approaches to evaluate the association of height and BMI on breast cancer risk, using data from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 with 14 676 BRCA1 and 7912 BRCA2 mutation carriers, including 11 451 cases of breast cancer. We created a height genetic score using 586 height-associated variants and a BMI genetic score using 93 BMI-associated variants. We examined both observed and genetically determined height and BMI with breast cancer risk using weighted Cox models. All statistical tests were two-sided., Results: Observed height was positively associated with breast cancer risk (HR = 1.09 per 10 cm increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 1.17; P = 1.17). Height genetic score was positively associated with breast cancer, although this was not statistically significant (per 10 cm increase in genetically predicted height, HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.17; P = .47). Observed BMI was inversely associated with breast cancer risk (per 5 kg/m2 increase, HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90 to 0.98; P = .007). BMI genetic score was also inversely associated with breast cancer risk (per 5 kg/m2 increase in genetically predicted BMI, HR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76 to 0.98; P = .02). BMI was primarily associated with premenopausal breast cancer., Conclusion: Height is associated with overall breast cancer and BMI is associated with premenopausal breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Incorporating height and BMI, particularly genetic score, into risk assessment may improve cancer management.

However, the causal direction of this relation remains ambiguous.Objective: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to infer the direction of causality between BMI and disordered eating in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.Design: MR analyses were conducted with a genetic score as an instrumental variable for BMI to assess the causal effect of BMI at age 7 y on disordered eating patterns at age 13 y with the use of data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (n = 4473). To examine causality in the reverse direction, MR analyses were used to estimate the effect of the same disordered eating patterns at age 13 y on BMI at age 17 y via a split-sample approach in the ALSPAC. We also investigated the causal direction of the association between BMI and eating disorders (EDs) in adults via a two-sample MR approach and publically available genome-wide association study data.Results: MR results indicated that higher BMI at age 7 y likely causes higher levels of binge eating and overeating, weight and shape concerns, and weight-control behavior patterns in both males and females and food restriction in males at age 13 y. Furthermore, results suggested that higher levels of binge eating and overeating in males at age 13 y likely cause higher BMI at age 17 y. We showed no evidence of causality between BMI and EDs in adulthood in either direction.Conclusions: This study provides evidence to suggest a causal effect of higher BMI in childhood and increased risk of disordered eating at age 13 y. Furthermore, higher levels of binge eating and overeating may cause higher BMI in later life. These results encourage an exploration of the ways to break the causal chain between these complex phenotypes, which could inform and prevent disordered eating problems in adolescence.

AB  - Background: Factorial Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants to answer questions about interactions. Although the approach has been used in applied investigations, little methodological advice is available on how to design or perform a factorial Mendelian randomization analysis. Previous analyses have employed a 2x2 approach, using dichotomized genetic scores to divide the population into 4 subgroups as in a factorial randomized trial. Methods: We describe two distinct contexts for factorial Mendelian randomization: investigating interactions between risk factors, and investigating interactions between pharmacological interventions on risk factors. We propose two-stage least squares methods using all available genetic variants and their interactions as instrumental variables, and using continuous genetic scores as instrumental variables rather than dichotomized scores. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to investigate the interaction between body mass index and alcohol consumption on systolic blood pressure. Results: Simulated and real data show that efficiency is maximized using the full set of interactions between genetic variants as instruments. In the applied example, between four- and ten-fold improvement in efficiency is demonstrated over the 2x2 approach. Analyses using continuous genetic scores are more efficient than those using dichotomized scores. Efficiency is improved by finding genetic variants that divide the population at a natural break in the distribution of the risk factor, or else divide the population into more equal sized groups. Conclusions: Previous factorial Mendelian randomization analyses may have been underpowered. Efficiency can be improved by using all genetic variants and their interactions as instrumental variables, rather than the 2x2 approach.

AB  - The age of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the genetic liability of complex disease using polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this study, we have analysed 162 PRS (P<5x10-05) derived from GWAS and 551 heritable traits from the UK Biobank study (N=334,398). Findings can be investigated using a web application (http://mrcieu.mrsoftware.org/PRS_atlas/), which we envisage will help uncover both known and novel mechanisms which contribute towards disease susceptibility. To demonstrate this, we have investigated the results from a phenome-wide evaluation of schizophrenia genetic liability. Amongst findings were inverse associations with measures of cognitive function which extensive follow-up analyses using Mendelian randomization (MR) provided evidence of a causal relationship. We have also investigated the effect of multiple risk factors on disease using mediation and multivariable MR frameworks. Our atlas provides a resource for future endeavours seeking to unravel the causal determinants of complex disease.

AB  - We have undertaken an extensive Mendelian randomization (MR) study using methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) as genetic instruments to assess the potential causal relationship between genetic variation, DNA methylation and 139 complex traits. Using two-sample MR, we observed 1,191 effects across 62 traits where genetic variants were associated with both proximal DNA methylation (i.e. cis-mQTL) and complex trait variation (P<1.39x10-08). Joint likelihood mapping provided evidence that the causal mQTL for 364 of these effects across 58 traits was also likely the causal variant for trait variation. These effects showed a high rate of replication in the UK Biobank dataset for 14 selected traits, as 121 of the attempted 129 effects replicated. Integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data suggested that genetic variants responsible for 319 of the 364 mQTL effects also influence gene expression, which indicates a coordinated system of effects that are consistent with causality. CpG sites were enriched for histone mark peaks in tissue types relevant to their associated trait and implicated genes were enriched across relevant biological pathways. Though we are unable to distinguish mediation from horizontal pleiotropy in these analyses, our findings should prove valuable in identifying candidate loci for further evaluation and help develop mechanistic insight into the aetiology of complex disease.

AB  - Insulin may serve as a key causal agent which regulates fat accumulation in the body. Here we assessed the causal relationship between fasting insulin and adiposity using publicly-available results from two large-scale genome-wide association studies for body mass index and fasting insulin levels in a two-sample, bidirectional Mendelian Randomized approach. This approach is only valid on the condition that the two instruments are independent of one another. In analysis excluding overlapping loci, there was an increase of 0.20 (0.17, 0.23) log pmol/L fasting insulin per SD increase in BMI (P= 2.80 x 10-36), while there was a null effect of fasting insulin on BMI, with a 0.01 (-0.39, 0.38) SD decrease in BMI per log pmol/L increase in fasting insulin (P= 0.98). Furthermore, a high degree of heterogeneity in the causal estimates was obtained from the insulin-related variants, which may be attributed to varying mechanisms of action of the insulin-associated variants. Results were largely consistent when an Egger regression technique and weighted median and mode estimators were applied. Findings suggest that the positive correlation between adiposity and fasting insulin levels are at least in part explained by the causal effect of adiposity on increasing insulin, rather than vice versa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional studies have shown that objectively measured physical activity is associated with childhood adiposity, and a strong inverse dose-response association with body mass index (BMI) has been found. However, few studies have explored the extent to which this association reflects reverse causation. We aimed to determine whether childhood adiposity causally influences levels of physical activity using genetic variants reliably associated with adiposity to estimate causal effects., METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children collected data on objectively assessed activity levels of 4,296 children at age 11 y with recorded BMI and genotypic data. We used 32 established genetic correlates of BMI combined in a weighted allelic score as an instrumental variable for adiposity to estimate the causal effect of adiposity on activity. In observational analysis, a 3.3 kg/m2 (one standard deviation) higher BMI was associated with 22.3 (95% CI, 17.0, 27.6) movement counts/min less total physical activity (p = 1.6x10-16), 2.6 (2.1, 3.1) min/d less moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity (p = 3.7x10-29), and 3.5 (1.5, 5.5) min/d more sedentary time (p = 5.0x10-4). In Mendelian randomization analyses, the same difference in BMI was associated with 32.4 (0.9, 63.9) movement counts/min less total physical activity (p = 0.04) (~5.3% of the mean counts/minute), 2.8 (0.1, 5.5) min/d less moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity (p = 0.04), and 13.2 (1.3, 25.2) min/d more sedentary time (p = 0.03). There was no strong evidence for a difference between variable estimates from observational estimates. Similar results were obtained using fat mass index. Low power and poor instrumentation of activity limited causal analysis of the influence of physical activity on BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increased adiposity causes a reduction in physical activity in children and support research into the targeting of BMI in efforts to increase childhood activity levels. Importantly, this does not exclude lower physical activity also leading to increased adiposity, i.e., bidirectional causation.

AB  - Multiple differentially methylated sites and regions associated with adiposity have now been identified in large-scale cross-sectional studies. We tested for replication of associations between previously identified CpG sites at HIF3A and adiposity in ~1,000 mother-offspring pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Availability of methylation and adiposity measures at multiple time points, as well as genetic data, allowed us to assess the temporal associations between adiposity and methylation and to make inferences regarding causality and directionality. Overall, our results were discordant with those expected if HIF3A methylation has a causal effect on BMI and provided more evidence for causality in the reverse direction (i.e., an effect of BMI on HIF3A methylation). These results are based on robust evidence from longitudinal analyses and were also partially supported by Mendelian randomization analysis, although this latter analysis was underpowered to detect a causal effect of BMI on HIF3A methylation. Our results also highlight an apparent long-lasting intergenerational influence of maternal BMI on offspring methylation at this locus, which may confound associations between own adiposity and HIF3A methylation. Further work is required to replicate and uncover the mechanisms underlying the direct and intergenerational effect of adiposity on DNA methylation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that greater maternal adiposity during pregnancy affects lifelong risk of offspring fatness via intrauterine mechanisms. Our aim was to use Mendelian randomisation (MR) to investigate the causal effect of intrauterine exposure to greater maternal body mass index (BMI) on offspring BMI and fat mass from childhood to early adulthood., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used maternal genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to test the causal effect of maternal BMI in pregnancy on offspring fatness (BMI and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] determined fat mass index [FMI]) in a MR approach. This was investigated, with repeat measurements, from ages 7 to 18 in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n = 2,521 to 3,720 for different ages). We then sought to replicate findings with results for BMI at age 6 in Generation R (n = 2,337 for replication sample; n = 6,057 for total pooled sample). In confounder-adjusted multivariable regression in ALSPAC, a 1 standard deviation (SD, equivalent of 3.7 kg/m2) increase in maternal BMI was associated with a 0.25 SD (95% CI 0.21-0.29) increase in offspring BMI at age 7, with similar results at later ages and when FMI was used as the outcome. A weighted genetic risk score was generated from 32 genetic variants robustly associated with BMI (minimum F-statistic = 45 in ALSPAC). The MR results using this genetic risk score as an IV in ALSPAC were close to the null at all ages (e.g., 0.04 SD (95% CI -0.21-0.30) at age 7 and 0.03 SD (95% CI -0.26-0.32) at age 18 per SD increase in maternal BMI), which was similar when a 97 variant generic risk score was used in ALSPAC. When findings from age 7 in ALSPAC were meta-analysed with those from age 6 in Generation R, the pooled confounder-adjusted multivariable regression association was 0.22 SD (95% CI 0.19-0.25) per SD increase in maternal BMI and the pooled MR effect (pooling the 97 variant score results from ALSPAC with the 32 variant score results from Generation R) was 0.05 SD (95%CI -0.11-0.21) per SD increase in maternal BMI (p-value for difference between the two results = 0.05). A number of sensitivity analyses exploring violation of the MR results supported our main findings. However, power was limited for some of the sensitivity tests and further studies with relevant data on maternal, offspring, and paternal genotype are required to obtain more precise (and unbiased) causal estimates., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide little evidence to support a strong causal intrauterine effect of incrementally greater maternal BMI resulting in greater offspring adiposity.

AB  - CONTEXT: Obesity is associated with short telomere length. The cause of this association is unknown., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that genetically increased body mass index (BMI) is associated with telomere length shortening and that low-grade inflammation might contribute through elevated C-reactive protein., SETTING AND DESIGN: We studied 45,069 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with measurements of leukocyte telomere length, BMI, and C-reactive protein in a Mendelian randomization study. Using the three obesity-associated polymorphisms FTO rs9939609, MC4R rs17782313, and TMEM18 rs6548238, and the CRP promoter polymorphism rs3091244 in instrumental variable analyses, we estimated the associations between genetically increased BMI and telomere length and between genetically increased C-reactive protein and telomere length., RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted observational analyses, telomere length decreased with seven base pairs (95% confidence interval, -9--5) per unit increase in BMI, and further adjustment for C-reactive protein attenuated this association to -5 base pairs (-8--3). In accordance, instrumental variable analysis showed a non-significant telomere length shortening of six base pairs (-37-25) per unit increase in genetically determined BMI. Furthermore, in observational analyses, telomere length decreased with nine base pairs (-16--2) for a doubling in C-reactive protein, supported by the instrumental variable analyses showing a corresponding genetically determined decrease of 66 base pairs (-124--7)., CONCLUSIONS: High BMI is associated with short telomere length observationally. This might possibly be mediated through elevated C-reactive protein, given that genetically elevated C-reactive protein levels are associated with short telomere length.

We aimed to understand the causal nature of the associations of common cardio-metabolic traits with cardiovascular (CVD)mortality and/or all-cause totalmortality using Mendelian randomization analyses. Materials and methods: Our study included 28589 participants fromthe population based Malmo Diet and Cancer study with a mean follow-up period of 15.4 years. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses by using trait specific weighted genetic risk scores (GRS) for BMI (comprising of 31 SNPs), systolic blood pressure (SBP;29 SNPs), HDLcholesterol (HDL-C; 41 SNPs), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C; 32 SNPs), triglycerides (TG; 26 SNPs) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 15 SNPs) as instrumental variables to investigate the causal role of these traits in CVD-mortality (1913 deaths) and total mortality (5708 deaths). We performed a 2-stage regression instrumental variable analysis. First, each cardio-metabolic trait was regressed on its respective GRS creating instrumental variables and second, the instrumental variables were used as predictor variables for CVD- and total mortality in Cox proportional hazards models. The analyses were adjusted for age and sex. Lipidlowering and antihypertensive medications were added to the model when lipid traits or SBP were used as outcome or predictor variables, respectively. Finally, we performed multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses using the effect estimates of each SNP first on all cardiometabolic traits and second, on CVD-mortality and total mortality to adjust for potential pleiotropic effects of the SNPs. Results: Higher baseline levels of SBP and FPG, and lower levels of HDL-C associated with increased risk of both CVD- and total mortality while higher BMI and TG associated only with increased risk of CVD-mortality. The variances explained by GRSs for BMI, SBP, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG and FPG were 0.8, 0.5, 7.2, 5.7, 4.3 and 2.2%, respectively, in association with their respective traits (P<10-15 for all). The instrumental variable analyses indicated that aone standard deviation (1SD) of genetically elevated BMI (HR: 1.82, 95%CI: 1.09-3.03; P: 0.02), LDL-C (1.20, 1.02-1.42; 0.03) and TG (1.28, 1.05-1.57; 0.02) associated with increased risk of CVD-mortality and a 1SD of genetically elevated HDLC (0.78, 0.65-0.93; 0.006) associated with decreased risk of CVD-mortality. Additionally, a 1SD of genetically elevated TG associated with increased risk of total mortality (1.18, 1.05-1.33, 0.005) and 1SD of genetically elevated HDL-C associated with decreased risk of total mortality (0.89, 0.80-0.99; 0.03). Adjusting for pleiotropic effects in the multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses proposed a direct causal association of TG (P=0.02) and an inverse association of HDL-C (P= 0.035) with CVD-mortality. Conclusion: While randomized clinical trials and Mendelian randomization studies have only provided evidence for causality of higher LDL-C and TG but not of lower HDL-C in coronary disease development, our results suggest a causal role of HDL-C in addition to TG in CVD-mortality. However, whether other cardiometabolic traits causally impact mortality requires further evidence.

AB  - Mendelian Randomisation (MR) is a powerful tool in epidemiology which can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding, by utilising genetic variants that are instrumental variables (IVs) for the exposure. This can be extended to Multivariable MR (MVMR) to estimate the effect of two or more exposures on an outcome. We use simulations and theoretical arguments to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a MVMR analysis under a range of underlying scenarios, where a secondary exposure acts variously as a confounder, a pleiotropic pathway, a mediator and a collider. We then describe how instrument strength and validity can be assessed for an MVMR analysis in the single sample setting, and how such tests can be extrapolated to the popular two-sample summary data setting. We illustrate our methods using data from UK biobank to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on body mass index. We show that MVMR analysis consistently estimates the effect of an exposure, or exposures, of interest and provides a powerful tool for determining causal effects in a wide range of scenarios with either individual or summary level data.

AB  - Background: A higher body mass index (BMI) is known to be associated with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [25(OH)D, an indicator for vitamin D status], although the direction of the relationship has not been proven. The aim of the study was to explore the causal direction of the relationship between obesity and vitamin D deficiency using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Methods: We used 12 BMIrelated SNPs and 4 vitamin D-related SNPs individually and in combination as instruments in the analyses on ~40,000 individuals from 21 studies. Results: In meta-analysis, each 10 unit increase in BMI was associated with 12% reduction in 25(OH)D. BMI score and the two vitamin D allele counts (formed separately for synthesis and metabolism SNPs) showed the expected strong associations with lnBMI and ln25(OH)D, respectively (p<0.0001 for three comparisons), with no evidence for heterogeneity by region, age, gender and assay suggesting these scores as valid instruments for MR analyses. The continuous BMI score was also associated with a decrease in ln25(OH)D [beta(95%CI)= -0.06(-0.10, -0.02), p= 0.003], while no association was seen between either vitamin D allele counts and lnBMI (synthesis allele count, p= 0.85; metabolism allele count, p= 0.09). In the instrumental variable analyses, we found a significant causal association of BMI score with ln25(OH)D [beta(95%CI)= -0.38(-0.64, -0.11), p= 0.005]. Conclusions: In conclusion, using a bidirectional genetic approach that limits confounding, our data suggests that increases in BMI lead to vitamin D deficiency, while evidence did not suggest that improvements in vitamin D status could contribute to reductions in BMI.

AB  - Increased sedentariness has been linked to the growing prevalence of obesity in children, but some longitudinal studies suggest that sedentariness may be a consequence rather than a cause of increased adiposity. We used Mendelian randomization to examine the causal relations between body mass index (BMI) and objectively assessed sedentary time and physical activity in 3-8 year-old children from one Finnish and two Danish cohorts [NTOTAL=679]. A genetic risk score (GRS) comprised of 15 independent genetic variants associated with childhood BMI was used as the instrumental variable to test causal effects of BMI on sedentary time, total physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). In fixed effects meta-analyses, the GRS was associated with 0.05 SD/allele increase in sedentary time (P=0.019), but there was no significant association with total physical activity (beta=0.011 SD/allele, P=0.58) or MVPA (beta=0.001 SD/allele, P=0.96), adjusting for age, sex, monitor wear-time and first three genome-wide principal components. In two-stage least squares regression analyses, each genetically instrumented one unit increase in BMI z-score increased sedentary time by 0.47 SD (P=0.072). Childhood BMI may have a causal influence on sedentary time but not on total physical activity or MVPA in young children. Our results provide important insights into the regulation of movement behaviour in childhood.

AB  - Mendelian randomisation (MR) is a method for establishing causality between a risk factor and an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental variables. In practice, the association between individual genetic variants and the risk factor is often weak, which may lead to a lack of precision in the MR and even biased MR estimates. Usually, the most significant variant within a genetic region is selected to represent the association with the risk factor, but there is no guarantee that this variant will be causal or that it will capture all of the genetic association within the region. It may be advantageous to use extra variants selected from the same region in the MR. The problem is to decide which variants to select. Rather than selecting a specific set of variants, we investigate the use of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to average the MR over all possible combinations of genetic variants. Our simulations demonstrate that the BMA version of MR outperforms classical estimation with many dependent variants and performs much better than an MR based on variants selected by penalised regression. In further simulations, we investigate robustness to violations in the model assumptions and demonstrate sensitivity to the inclusion of invalid instruments. The method is illustrated by applying it to an MR of the effect of body mass index on blood pressure using SNPs in the FTO gene.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: In addition to the established association between general obesity and breast cancer risk, central obesity and circulating fasting insulin and glucose have been linked to the development of this common malignancy. Findings from previous studies, however, have been inconsistent, and the nature of the associations is unclear., Methods: We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to evaluate the association of breast cancer risk, using genetic instruments, with fasting insulin, fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, body mass index (BMI) and BMI-adjusted waist-hip-ratio (WHRadj BMI). We first confirmed the association of these instruments with type 2 diabetes risk in a large diabetes genome-wide association study consortium. We then investigated their associations with breast cancer risk using individual-level data obtained from 98 842 cases and 83 464 controls of European descent in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium., Results: All sets of instruments were associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Associations with breast cancer risk were found for genetically predicted fasting insulin [odds ratio (OR) = 1.71 per standard deviation (SD) increase, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-2.31, p = 5.09 x 10-4], 2-h glucose (OR = 1.80 per SD increase, 95% CI = 1.3 0-2.49, p = 4.02 x 10-4), BMI (OR = 0.70 per 5-unit increase, 95% CI = 0.65-0.76, p = 5.05 x 10-19) and WHRadj BMI (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79-0.91, p = 9.22 x 10-6). Stratified analyses showed that genetically predicted fasting insulin was more closely related to risk of estrogen-receptor [ER]-positive cancer, whereas the associations with instruments of 2-h glucose, BMI and WHRadj BMI were consistent regardless of age, menopausal status, estrogen receptor status and family history of breast cancer., Conclusions: We confirmed the previously reported inverse association of genetically predicted BMI with breast cancer risk, and showed a positive association of genetically predicted fasting insulin and 2-h glucose and an inverse association of WHRadj BMI with breast cancer risk. Our study suggests that genetically determined obesity and glucose/insulin-related traits have an important role in the aetiology of breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The observational relationship between obesity and periodontitis is widely known, yet causal evidence is lacking. Our objective was to investigate causal associations between periodontitis and body mass index (BMI)., METHODS: We performed Mendelian randomization analyses with BMI-associated loci combined in a genetic risk score (GRS) as the instrument for BMI. All analyses were conducted within the Gene-Lifestyle Interactions and Dental Endpoints (GLIDE) Consortium in 13 studies from Europe and the USA, including 49,066 participants with clinically assessed (seven studies, 42.1% of participants) and self-reported (six studies, 57.9% of participants) periodontitis and genotype data (17,672/31,394 with/without periodontitis); 68,761 participants with BMI and genotype data; and 57,871 participants (18,881/38,990 with/without periodontitis) with data on BMI and periodontitis., RESULTS: In the observational meta-analysis of all participants, the pooled crude observational odds ratio (OR) for periodontitis was 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.24] per standard deviation increase of BMI. Controlling for potential confounders attenuated this estimate (OR = 1.08; 95% CI:1.03, 1.12). For clinically assessed periodontitis, corresponding ORs were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.42) and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.17), respectively. In the genetic association meta-analysis, the OR for periodontitis was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.03) per GRS unit (per one effect allele) in all participants and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.03) in participants with clinically assessed periodontitis. The instrumental variable meta-analysis of all participants yielded an OR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.38) per BMI standard deviation, and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.46) in participants with clinical data., CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not support total adiposity as a causal risk factor for periodontitis, as the point estimate is very close to the null in the causal inference analysis, with wide confidence intervals.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity is consistently implicated in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene(rs9939609) is strongly associated with body mass index (BMI). Caucasian adults homozygous for the minor (A) allele were 3-4 kg heavier and demonstrated a 1.7-fold increase in the odds of obesity compared to those without the AA genotype1. We aimed to determine whether FTO genotype is associated with either the presence or severity of OSA and to explore the potential causal relationship between BMI and OSA severity. Methods: OSA cases comprised European subjects from the WA Sleep Health Study who had polysomnography-defined OSA (Apnoea Hypopnea Index; AHI >= 5). Controls comprised European participants from the 1994-95 Busselton Health Study who were screened using questionnaire data for the probable absence of moderate to severe OSA.Cases and controls were genotyped for FTO (rs9939609). AHI was used to define OSA severity. The role of the FTO SNP in the presence of andseverity of OSA were investigated using multivariate analyses of AHI, age, BMI and FTO genotype. Mendelian Randomisation (MR) analysis utilises the random assignment of a genotype to make causal inferences about environmental risk factors for disease outcomes. In this study the FTO SNP (rs9939609) will be used as an instrumental variable for BMI to assess the relationship between BMI and AHI. Results: There were 1240 cases and 1955 controls. FTO was not associated with either the presence or severity of OSA. BMI adjusted for age and sex was significantly associated with Loge(AHI) (P < 0.001) explaining22% of the variance. Within OSA patients the FTO genotype was associated with BMI (P = 0.01). These traditional epidemiological associations suggest that FTO may be a suitable instrument variable for investigating the relationship between BMI and AHI. Discussion: The FTO gene had no association with OSA susceptibilityor severity. Multivariate associations suggest that BMI impacts severityof OSA however the association does not imply causation. Analyses using Mendelian randomisation techniques will be presented which may further elucidate the relationship between OSA and obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown that body mass index (BMI) is positively associated with asthma. However, observational data are prone to confounding and reverse causation. In Mendelian randomization, genetic variants are used as unconfounded markers of exposures to examine causal effects. We examined the causal effect of BMI on asthma, hay fever, allergic sensitization, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)., METHODS: We included 490 497 participants in the observational and 162 124 participants in the genetic analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created using 26 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) or beta-estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI)., RESULTS: The GRS was significantly associated with asthma (OR=1.009; 95% CI: 1.004, 1.013), but not with hay fever (OR= 0.998; 95% CI: 0.994, 1.002) or allergic sensitization (OR=0.999; 95% CI: 0.986, 1.012) per BMI-increasing allele. The GRS was significantly associated with decrease in FEV1: beta=-0.0012 (95% CI: -0.0019, -0.0006) and FVC: beta=-0.0022 (95% CI: -0.0031, -0.0014) per BMI-increasing allele. Effect sizes estimated by instrumental variable analyses were OR=1.07 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.10) for asthma, a 9 ml decrease in FEV1 (95% CI: 2.0-15 mL decrease) and a 16 ml decrease in FVC (95% CI: 7.0-24 mL decrease) per 1 kg/m2 higher BMI., CONCLUSIONS: The results support the conclusion that increasing BMI is causally related to higher prevalence of asthma and decreased lung function, but not with hay fever or biomarkers of allergy.

AB  - Introduction: Observational studies have shown strong associations between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, these designs cannot rule out residual confounding or reverse causation. Using Mendelian randomization (MR), we aimed to test the hypothesis that NAFLD is causally related to (sub)clinical measures of T2D and CVD. Methods: We selected nine lead SNPs for loci known to associate with diagnosis of NAFLD in recent literature, but without known pleiotropic effects on glucose-metabolism pathways (LYPLAL1, FDFT1, COL13A1, LTBP3, EFCAB4B, NCAN, PDGFA, TM6SF2, PNPLA3). We examined the combined effects of these variants using an unweighted genetic risk score (i.e. possible range 0-18), against hepatic triglyceride content (n = 1,818), ALT and AST levels, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, intima-media thickness, and pulse wave velocity (n = 2,161) in 5,711 individuals aged 45-65 years from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, and against incident CVD, incident T2D, and mortality outcomes in 5,804 individuals aged 70-82 years from the PROspective study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk. In addition, using external weights from a large-scale GWAS on CT-measured liver fat for three of the genetic instruments (LYPLAL1, NCAN, PNPLA3), we calculated inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR estimators using publically available GWAS data from the MAGIC (fasted glucose, HOMA-IR, n = 46,186), DIAGRAM (T2D, n = 69,033), and CARDIoGRAM+C4D (coronary artery disease (CAD), n = 184,305) consortia. Results: The NAFLD-GRS was associated with increased liver triglyceride content (1.05 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.09) relative change per-allele), higher ALT (0.32 (0.13, 0.50) mmol/L per-allele) and AST (0.12 (0.00, 0.25) mmol/L per-allele), but not with fasting glucose (0.00 (-0.01, 0.02) mmol/L per-allele) or HOMA-IR (1.00 (0.99, 1.02) relative change per-allele). In addition, we did not observe evidence of associations with subclinical or clinically overt CVD outcomes, T2D, or mortality. Findings from large-scale GWAS consortia were in line with these Results, as the IVW-MR estimators did not show clear evidence of associations with fasting glucose (0.02 (-0.04, 0.08) mmol/L per unit increase in genetically raised liver fat), HOMA-IR (0.03 (-0.04, 0.10)), T2D (odds ratio (OR) 1.28 (0.71, 2.31), or CAD (OR 0.94 (0.74, 1.19). Conclusion: Based on our selection of genetic instruments, our findings suggest that the previously observed associations between NAFLD and liver fat with high risk of T2D and CVD in observational studies might not be causal.

AB  - Obesity and depression are major public health concerns that are both associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. There is a considerable body of literature linking obesity to the development of depression. Recent studies using Mendelian Randomization indicate that this relationship is causal. Most studies of the obesity-depression association have used body mass index as a measure of obesity. Body mass index is defined as weight (measured in kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters) and therefore does not distinguish between the contributions of fat and non-fat to body weight. To better understand the obesity-depression association, we conduct a Mendelian Randomization study of the relationship between fat mass, non-fat mass, height, and depression, using genome-wide association study results from the UK Biobank (n=332,000) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (n=480,000). Our findings suggest that both fat mass and height (short stature) are causal risk factors for depression, while non-fat mass is not. These results represent important new knowledge on the role of anthropometric measures in the etiology of depression. They also suggest that reducing fat mass will decrease the risk of depression, which lends further support to public health measures aimed at reducing the obesity epidemic.

AB  - Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) has developed into an established method for strengthening causal inference and estimating causal effects, largely due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies. However, genetic instruments remain controversial, as horizontal pleiotropic effects can introduce bias into causal estimates. Recent work has highlighted the potential of gene-environment interactions in detecting and correcting for pleiotropic bias in MR analyses., Methods: We introduce MR using Gene-by-Environment interactions (MRGxE) as a framework capable of identifying and correcting for pleiotropic bias. If an instrument-covariate interaction induces variation in the association between a genetic instrument and exposure, it is possible to identify and correct for pleiotropic effects. The interpretation of MRGxE is similar to conventional summary MR approaches, with a particular advantage of MRGxE being the ability to assess the validity of an individual instrument., Results: We investigate the effect of adiposity, measured using body mass index (BMI), upon systolic blood pressure (SBP) using data from the UK Biobank and a single weighted allelic score informed by data from the GIANT consortium. We find MRGxE produces findings in agreement with two-sample summary MR approaches. Further, we perform simulations highlighting the utility of the approach even when the MRGxE assumptions are violated., Conclusions: By utilizing instrument-covariate interactions in MR analyses implemented within a linear-regression framework, it is possible to identify and correct for horizontal pleiotropic bias, provided the average magnitude of pleiotropy is constant across interaction-covariate subgroups.

AB  - Mendelian randomization, the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables (IV), can test for and estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Most IV methods assume that the function relating the exposure to the expected value of the outcome (the exposure-outcome relationship) is linear. However, in practice this assumption may not hold. Indeed, often the primary question of interest is to assess the shape of this relationship. We present two novel IV methods for investigating the shape of the exposure-outcome relationship: a fractional polynomial method and a piecewise linear method. We divide the population into strata using the exposure distribution, and estimate a causal effect, referred to as a localized average causal effect (LACE), in each stratum of population. The fractional polynomial method performs meta-regression on these LACE estimates. The piecewise linear method estimates a continuous piecewise linear function, the gradient of which is the LACE estimate in each stratum. Both methods were demonstrated in a simulation study to estimate the true exposure-outcome relationship well, particularly when the relationship was a fractional polynomial (for the fractional polynomial method) or was piecewise linear (for the piecewise linear method). The methods were used to investigate the shape of relationship of body mass index with systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with an increased risk of gallstone disease. Whether this reflects a causal association is unknown. Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we studied 77,679 individuals from the general population. Of these, 4,106 developed symptomatic gallstone disease during up to 34 years of follow-up. Subjects were genotyped for three common variants known to associate with BMI: FTO(rs9939609); MC4R(rs17782313); and TMEM18(rs6548238). The number of BMI-increasing alleles was calculated for each participant. In observational analyses, mean baseline BMI was 55% (11.6 kg/m(2) ) increased in individuals in the fifth quintile versus the first quintile, similar in women and men. The corresponding multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for symptomatic gallstone disease was 2.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.32-3.46) overall, 3.36 (95% CI: 2.62-4.31) in women, and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.09-2.11) in men (P trend: 0.001 to <0.001; P interaction: BMI*sex on risk = 0.01). In genetic analyses, carrying 6 versus 0-1 BMI-increasing alleles was associated with a 5.2% (1.3 kg/m(2) ) increase in BMI overall and with increases of 4.3% in women and 6.1% in men (all P trend: <0.001). Corresponding HRs for symptomatic gallstone disease were 1.43 (95% CI: 0.99-2.05) overall, 1.54 (95% CI: 1.00-2.35) in women, and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.60-2.38) in men (P trend = 0.007, 0.02, and 0.26, respectively; P interaction allele score*sex on risk = 0.49). The estimated causal odds ratio (OR) for symptomatic gallstone disease, by instrumental variable analysis for a 1 kg/m(2) increase in genetically determined BMI, was 1.17 (95% CI: 0.99-1.37) overall and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00-1.44) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.90-1.16) in women and men, respectively. Corresponding observational HRs were 1.07 (95% CI: 1.06-1.08), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07-1.10), and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02-1.07), respectively., CONCLUSION: These results are compatible with a causal association between elevated BMI and increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease, which is most pronounced in women.

AB  - Little is known about the causes of meningioma. Obesity and obesity-related traits have been reported in several epidemiological observational studies to be risk factors for meningioma. We performed an analysis of genetic variants associated with obesity-related traits to assess the relationship with meningioma risk using Mendelian randomization (MR), an approach unaffected by biases from temporal variability and reverse causation that might have affected earlier investigations. We considered 11 obesity-related traits, identified genetic instruments for these factors, and assessed their association with meningioma risk using data from a genome-wide association study comprising 1,606 meningioma patients and 9,823 controls. To evaluate the causal relationship between the obesity-related traits and meningioma risk, we consider the estimated odds ratio (OR) of meningioma for each genetic instrument. We identified positive associations between body mass index (odds ratio [ORSD] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.56, P = 0.028) and body fat percentage (ORSD = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.63, P = 0.042) with meningioma risk, albeit non-significant after correction for multiple testing. Associations for basal metabolic rate, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides and waist circumference with risk of meningioma were non-significant. Our analysis provides additional support for obesity being associated with an increased risk of meningioma.

AB  - Obesity and diabetes are both major public health issues and are risk factors for each other. Recent genome wide studies have identified several genetic variants associated with either obesity, diabetes, or both. Because of the known interdependence between obesity and diabetes we hypothesize that some of these SNPs that are associated with both obesity and dia-betes may be mediated through obesity to affect diabetes or through diabetes to affect obesity. Identifying these mediated relationships would further enhance our knowledge about diabetes and obesity. We propose a framework for performing bidirectional mediation analyses. Through, simulations, we showed the statistical properties of our methods. In many scenarios, the residuals of mediator and outcome are correlated because of unmeasured predictors not included in the mediation model. We showed that the proposed model gives unbiased estimates in this scenario too. We applied the proposed model to investigate the bidirectional relationship between the diabetes and obesity using the genome wide association study data from the MESA cohort. We identified 6 SNPs that were associated with both diabetes and obesity. Two SNPs (rs3752355 and rs6087982) had indirect effects on obesity mediated through diabetes (0.28; 95% CI [0.01, 0.67] and 0.36; 95% CI [0.08, 0.85], respectively). The remaining four SNPs (rs7969190, rs4869710, rs10201400 and rs12421620) directly affect diabetes and obesity without any mediation effects.

AB  - Objectives: Observational studies have shown that greater height is associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP), and higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Height may be a proxy for early life circumstances or other behavioural or psychosocial factors, and thus confound these observations. Genetic variants are unlikely to be affected by confounders and cannot be influenced by reverse causation. We investigated the causal effect of adult height on blood pressure and arterial stiffness using instrumental variable (IV) Mendelian randomization (MR) meta-Analysis. Method(s): We performed two-Sample and multivariable MR analysis using previously published summary statistics of GWAS meta-Analysis. Independent SNPS associated with height (primary exposure), BMI and waist circumference were selected. The outcomes were SBP, DBP (N = 317754) and Arterial Stiffness Index (ASI) (N = 109813) from UK-Biobank genome wide analysis. We performed inverse-Variance weighted MR (IVW) as main analyses and MR-Egger regression to explore pleiotropy. The analyses were performed on the MR-Base platform. Result(s): Two sample analyses showed a causal relationship between greater height and lower SBP and higher ASI (figure). Causal effects per standard deviation increase in genetically determined height on SBP (IVW =-0.06 +/- 0.01, P = 1.6E-09; MR-Egger =-0.05 +/- 0.01, P = 0.04) and ASI (IVW = 0.07 +/- 0.01, P = 1.5E-12; MR-Egger = 0.12 +/- 0.03, P = 1.2E-06) but not DBP (Egger P value = 0.6). Multivariable MR including BMI and waist circumference as exposures confirmed the causal effect of height on SBP (-0.084 +/- 0.02, P = 1.5E-05) and ASI (0.06(0.09, P = 0.0006) but not DBP. Conclusion(s): Genetically predicted height is causally associated with higher systolic BP and lower arterial stiffness index with no association with diastolic B P.

AB  - Background Given clear evidence that smoking lowers weight, it is possible that individuals with higher body mass index (BMI) smoke in order to lose or maintain their weight. Methods and Findings We undertook Mendelian randomization analyses using 97 genetic variants associated with BMI. We performed two sample Mendelian randomization analyses of the effects of BMI on smoking behaviour in UK Biobank (N=335,921) and the Tobacco and Genetics consortium genomewide association study (GWAS) (N≤74,035) respectively, and two sample Mendelian randomization analyses of the effects of BMI on cotinine levels (N≤4,548) and nicotine metabolite ratio (N≤1,518) in published GWAS, and smoking-related DNA methylation in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N≤846). In inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization analysis, there was evidence that higher BMI was causally associated with smoking initiation (OR for ever vs never smoking per one SD increase in BMI: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.27) and smoking heaviness (1.45 additional cigarettes smoked per day per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.86), but little evidence for a causal effect with smoking cessation. Results were broadly similar using pleiotropy robust methods (MR-Egger, median and weighted mode regression). These results were supported by evidence for a causal effect of BMI on DNA methylation at the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) locus. There was no strong evidence that BMI was causally associated with cotinine, but suggestive evidence for a causal negative association with the nicotine metabolite ratio. Conclusions There is a causal bidirectional association between BMI and smoking, but the relationship is likely to be complex due to opposing effects on behaviour and metabolism. It may be useful to consider BMI and smoking together when designing prevention strategies to minimise the effects of these risk factors on health outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity is associated with adverse cardiac effects in observational studies; however, bias and reverse causation prevent causal inference. We determined causal relationships between higher body mass index (BMI) and cardiac measures in young adults using Mendelian Randomisation. Methods: We estimated the causal effect of higher BMI on measures of cardiac structure and function using Mendelian randomisation (MR) from 1571 young adults in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (age 17.8 years; 51% male). The causal effect of BMI was estimated using a genetic risk score as an instrumental variable. Data are mean (95% confidence interval) per unit increase in BMI (kg.m-2). Results: Higher BMI caused higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure (0.8 (0.3, 1.8)/0.3 (0.0, 0.6) mmHg), increased left atrial size (0.08 (0.05, 0.11) cm), increased end diastolic volume (2.0 (0.6, 3.5) ml), left ventricular mass indexed to height2.7 (1.07 (0.62, 1.52)) and cardiac output (79.0 (18.2, 139.9) ml/min). The elevated cardiac output was likely attributable to a higher stroke volume (1.0 (0.1, 1.9) ml) as results showed no evidence of a causal effect of BMI on heart rate (-0.1 (-0.5, 0.4) bpm). Other cardiac measures, including total arterial compliance, systemic vascular resistance and measures of systolic and diastolic function, were only marginally or not affected. Conclusion: In young adults increased BMI results in higher left ventricular mass, atrial size and blood pressure. Higher blood pressure is wholly attributable to elevated stroke volume at this age. Other associations observed in observational analyses may represent confounding or reverse causation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which changes in gene expression can influence cardiovascular disease risk across different tissue types has not yet been systematically explored. We have developed an analysis pipeline that integrates tissue-specific gene expression, Mendelian randomization and multiple-trait colocalization to develop functional mechanistic insight into the causal pathway from a genetic variant to a complex trait., METHODS: We undertook an expression quantitative trait loci-wide association study to uncover genetic variants associated with both nearby gene expression and cardiovascular traits. Fine-mapping was performed to prioritize possible causal variants for detected associations. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was then applied using findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate whether changes in gene expression within certain tissue types may influence cardiovascular trait variation. We subsequently used Bayesian multiple-trait colocalization to further interrogate the findings and also gain insight into whether DNA methylation, as well as gene expression, may play a role in disease susceptibility. Finally, we applied our analysis pipeline genome-wide using summary statistics from large-scale GWAS., RESULTS: Eight genetic loci were associated with changes in gene expression and measures of cardiovascular function. Our MR analysis provided evidence of tissue-specific effects at multiple loci, of which the effects at the ADCY3 and FADS1 loci for body mass index and cholesterol, respectively, were particularly insightful. Multiple-trait colocalization uncovered evidence which suggested that changes in DNA methylation at the promoter region upstream of FADS1/TMEM258 may also affect cardiovascular trait variation along with gene expression. Furthermore, colocalization analyses uncovered evidence of tissue specificity between gene expression in liver tissue and cholesterol levels. Applying our pipeline genome-wide using summary statistics from GWAS uncovered 233 association signals at loci which represent promising candidates for further evaluation., CONCLUSIONS: Disease susceptibility can be influenced by differential changes in tissue-specific gene expression and DNA methylation. The approach undertaken in our study can be used to elucidate mechanisms in disease, as well as helping prioritize putative causal genes at associated loci where multiple nearby genes may be co-regulated. Future studies which continue to uncover quantitative trait loci for molecular traits across various tissue and cell types will further improve our capability to understand and prevent disease.

Multiple trait colocalization uncovered evidence which suggested that changes in DNA methylation at the promoter region upstream of FADS1/TMEM258 may also play a role in cardiovascular trait variation along with gene expression. Furthermore, colocalization analyses were able to uncover evidence of tissue-specificity, most prominantly between SORT1 expression in liver tissue and cholesterol levels. Conclusions: Disease susceptibility can be influenced by differential changes in tissue-specific gene expression and DNA methylation. Our analytical framework should prove valuable in elucidating mechanisms in disease, as well as helping prioritize putative causal genes at associated loci where multiple nearby genes may be co-regulated.

AB  - CONTEXT: Free T3 (FT3) has been positively associated with body mass index (BMI) in cross-sectional studies in healthy individuals. This is difficult to reconcile with clinical findings in pathological thyroid dysfunction., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether childhood adiposity influences FT3 levels., DESIGN: Mendelian randomization using genetic variants robustly associated with BMI., SETTING: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a population-based birth cohort., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3014 children who had thyroid function measured at age 7, who also underwent dual x-ray absorptiometry scans at ages 9.9 and 15.5 years and have genetic data available., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: FT3., RESULTS: Observationally at age 7 years, BMI was positively associated with FT3: beta-standardized (beta-[std]) = 0.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.16), P = 4.02 x 10(-10); whereas FT4 was negatively associated with BMI: beta-(std) = -0.08 (95% CI: -0.12, -0.04), P = 3.00 x 10(-5). These differences persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and early life environment. Genetic analysis indicated 1 allele change in BMI allelic score was associated with a 0.04 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.04) SD increase in BMI (P = 6.41 x 10(-17)). At age 7, a genetically determined increase in BMI of 1.89 kg/m(2) was associated with a 0.22 pmol/L (95% CI: 0.07, 0.36) increase in FT3 (P = .004) but no substantial change in FT4 0.01 mmol/L, (95% CI: -0.37, 0.40), P = .96., CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that children with a genetically higher BMI had higher FT3 but not FT4 levels, indicating that higher BMI/fat mass has a causal role in increasing FT3 levels. This may explain the paradoxical associations observed in observational analyses. Given rising childhood obesity levels, this relationship merits closer scrutiny.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetuin-A is associated with body mass index (BMI) as well as components of the metabolic syndrome. However, it is unclear if fetuin-A affects BMI or the other way around. We therefore assessed the causal association between fetuin-A and BMI or vice versa, utilizing a bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach., DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a study of 2558 subjects from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) cohort. Two polymorphisms, that is, rs2248690 in the alpha2-Hereman-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG) gene and rs9939609 in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene were genotyped. Bidirectional causal models were constructed using a two-stage least-square instrumental variable (IV) regression. First, rs2248690 locus was used as the instrumental variable for the effect of circulating fetuin-A on BMI, and then, the FTO rs9939609 locus was used as the instrumental variable for the effect of BMI on circulating fetuin-A., RESULTS: Among the 2558 subjects, the prevalence of the minor AHSG (T) and FTO (A) alleles was 17.9% and 22.1%, respectively. The AHSG rs2248690 locus was highly related to serum fetuin-A levels (P < 0.001). Likewise, the FTO rs9939609 locus and BMI were highly associated (P < 0.001). Mendelian randomization analyses showed that circulating fetuin-A, instrumented by the AHSG rs2248690 locus, was associated with BMI (coefficient = 2.26; 95% CI: 0.39, 4.12). In contrast, BMI, instrumented by the FTO rs9939609 locus, was not associated with circulating fetuin-A (coefficient = 0.0007; 95% CI: -0.0242, 0.0256)., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a causal association leading from circulating fetuin-A to BMI. There was no evidence of reverse causality from BMI to fetuin-A. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Mendelian randomization (MR) is a technique that seeks to establish causation between an exposure and an outcome using observational data. It is an instrumental variable analysis in which genetic variants are used as the instruments. Many consortia have meta-analysed genome-wide associations between variants and specific traits and made their results publicly available. Using such data, it is possible to derive genetic risk scores for one trait and to deduce the association of that same risk score with a second trait. The properties of this approach are investigated by simulation and by evaluating the potentially causal effect of birth weight on adult glucose level. In such analyses, it is important to decide whether one is interested in the risk score based on a set of estimated regression coefficients or the score based on the true underlying coefficients. MR is primarily concerned with the latter. Methods designed for the former question will under-estimate the variance if used for MR. This variance can be corrected but it needs to be done with care to avoid introducing bias. MR based on public data sources is useful and easy to perform, but care must be taken to avoid false precision or bias.

AB  - Background: Obesity has been consistently linked to higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in men, whereas the association is generally lower in women. Although these findings come from well conducted epidemiologic studies, it is difficult to exclude all other explanations for associations in observational studies, such as measurement error and other forms of bias, reverse causality and confounding. Mendelian randomization studies, using instrumental variables (IVs), can overcome some of the inherent limitations of observational studies and provide an unbiased and unconfounded estimate of the causal association between an exposure and outcome. Objective: We used genetic variants that are associated with body mass index (BMI) or waist-hip ratio (WHR) to examine the causal association between obesity and CRC. Methods: We used epidemiologic and genetic data from 10 226 CRC cases and 10 286 controls of European ancestry from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) or the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). The primary Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using a genetic risk score, derived from 77 established "BMI-increasing" genetic variants, as an instrumental variable for higher BMI. We additionally derived a risk score for WHR using 47 variants for WHR. We compared the IV odds ratio (OR) with the OR obtained using a traditional multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, family history, aspirin use, and HRT use (women). Results: For men and women combined, in traditional multivariable analysis, each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a 24% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.32) increase in risk of CRC. In the IV analysis, the OR was higher (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2=1.54, 95% CI: 1.15-2.06); however, the two estimates were not statistically significantly different (Pdifference=0.07). For men, there was a statistically significant association between BMI and CRC in traditional multivariable analysis (OR per 5kg/m2=1.33, 95% CI: 1.21-1.46), but no association in the IV analysis (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2=1.13, 95% CI: 0.70-1.83). The estimates however were not significantly different (Pdifference=0.56). In contrast, for women, the IV estimate (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2=1.94, 95% CI: 1.33-2.82) was significantly higher than the estimate from the traditional multivariable analysis (OR per 5 kg/m2=1.18, 95% CI: 1.11-1.25; Pdifference=0.01). In secondary analysis, we found a positive association between WHR and CRC in men (IV-OR per 0.1 unit increase=1.84, 95% CI: 1.02-3.31) but no statistically significant association in women (IV-OR per 0.1 unit increase=1.22, 95% CI: 0.75-1.98). Conclusions: Obesity is independently associated with risk of CRC and may confer greater risk of CRC in women than previously reported. The mechanisms remain largely unknown; however these results suggest that visceral abdominal fat may be particularly important for promoting CRC in men.

AB  - Background: High body mass index (BMI) is consistently linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer for men, whereas the association is less clear for women. As risk estimates from observational studies may be biased and/or confounded, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study to estimate the causal association between BMI and colorectal cancer. Methods:Weused data from 10,226 colorectal cancer cases and 10,286 controls of European ancestry. The Mendelian randomization analysis used a weighted genetic risk score, derived from 77 genome-wide association study-identified variants associated with higher BMI, as an instrumental variable (IV). We compared the IV odds ratio (IV-OR) with the OR obtained using a conventional covariate-adjusted analysis. Results: Individuals carrying greater numbers of BMI-increasing alleles had higher colorectal cancer risk [per weighted allele OR, 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.57]. Our IV estimation results support the hypothesis that genetically influenced BMI is directly associated with risk for colorectal cancer (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13-2.01). In the sex-specific IV analyses higher BMI was associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer among women (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.26-2.61). For men, genetically influenced BMI was not associated with colorectal cancer (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.73-1.92). Conclusions: High BMI was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk for women. Whether abdominal obesity, rather than overall obesity, is a more important risk factor for men requires further investigation. Impact: Overall, conventional epidemiologic and Mendelian randomization studies suggest a strong association between obesity and the risk of colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data from observational studies suggest that body mass index (BMI) is causally related to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, the relationships may be affected by bias and confounding., METHODS: We used data from the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Genetic Susceptibility Study: 999 patients with EAC, 2061 patients with BE, and 2169 population controls. We applied the two-stage control function instrumental variable method of the Mendelian randomization approach to estimate the unbiased, unconfounded effect of BMI on risk of EAC and BE. This was performed using a genetic risk score, derived from 29 genetic variants shown to be associated with BMI, as an instrument for lifetime BMI. A higher score indicates propensity to obesity. All tests were two-sided., RESULTS: The genetic risk score was not associated with potential confounders, including gastroesophageal reflux symptoms and smoking. In the instrumental variable analyses (IV), EAC risk increased by 16% (IV-odds ratio [OR] = 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 1.33) and BE risk increased by 12% (IV-OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.25) per 1kg/m(2) increase in BMI. BMI was statistically significantly associated with EAC and BE in conventional epidemiologic analyses., CONCLUSIONS: People with a high genetic propensity to obesity have higher risks of esophageal metaplasia and neoplasia than people with low genetic propensity. These analyses provide the strongest evidence to date that obesity is independently associated with BE and EAC, and is not due to confounding or bias inherent in conventional epidemiologic analyses.

AB  - Aims: Increases in fat-free mass and fat mass have been associated with higher risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in observational studies. It is not known whether these associations reflect independent causal processes. Our aim was to evaluate independent causal roles of fat-free mass and fat mass on AF., Methods and results: We conducted a large observational study to estimate the associations between fat-free mass and fat mass on incident AF in the UK Biobank (N = 487 404, N events = 10 365). Genome-wide association analysis was performed to obtain genetic instruments for Mendelian randomization (MR). We evaluated the causal effects of fat-free mass and fat mass on AF with two-sample method by using genetic associations from AFGen consortium as outcome. Finally, we evaluated independent causal effects of fat-free mass and fat mass with multivariate MR. Both fat-free mass and fat mass had observational associations with incident AF [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72-1.83; HR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.37-1.43 per standard deviation increase in fat-free and fat mass, respectively]. The causal effects using the inverse-variance weighted method were 1.55 (95% CI 1.38-1.75) for fat-free mass and 1.30 (95% CI 1.17-1.45) for fat mass. Weighted median, Egger regression, and penalized methods showed similar estimates. The multivariate MR analysis suggested that the causal effects of fat-free and fat mass were independent of each other (causal risk ratios: 1.37, 95% CI 1.06-1.75; 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.58)., Conclusion: Genetically programmed increases in fat-free mass and fat mass independently cause an increased risk of AF.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether educational attainment is a causal risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease. Design: Mendelian randomization study, where genetic data are used as proxies for education, in order to minimize confounding. A two-sample design was applied, where summary level genetic data was analysed from two publically available consortia. Setting: In the main analysis, we analysed genetic data from two large consortia (CARDIoGRAM and SSGAC), comprising of 112 cohorts from predominantly high-income countries. In addition, we also analysed genetic data from 7 additional large consortia, in order to identify putative causal mediators. Participants: The main analysis was of 589 377 men and women, predominantly of European origin. Exposure: A one standard deviation increase in the genetic predisposition towards higher education (i.e. 3.6 years of additional schooling). This was measured by 162 genetic variants that have been previously associated with education. Main outcome: Combined fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (63 746 events). Results: 3.6 years of additional education lowered the risk of coronary heart disease by a third (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.77, p=0.01). Equivalent increases in education were also causally associated with reductions in smoking, BMI and improvements in blood lipid profiles. Conclusions: More time spent in education is causally associated with a large reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. This may be partly explained by changes to smoking, BMI and a blood lipids. These findings offer support for policy interventions that increase education, in order to also reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Objective To determine whether educational attainment is a causal risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease.Design Mendelian randomisation study, using genetic data as proxies for education to minimise confounding.Setting The main analysis used genetic data from two large consortia (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D and SSGAC), comprising 112 studies from predominantly high income countries. Findings from mendelian randomisation analyses were then compared against results from traditional observational studies (164 170 participants). Finally, genetic data from six additional consortia were analysed to investigate whether longer education can causally alter the common cardiovascular risk factors.Participants The main analysis was of 543 733 men and women (from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D and SSGAC), predominantly of European origin.Exposure A one standard deviation increase in the genetic predisposition towards higher education (3.6 years of additional schooling), measured by 162 genetic variants that have been previously associated with education.Main outcome measure Combined fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease (63 746 events in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D).Results Genetic predisposition towards 3.6 years of additional education was associated with a one third lower risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.77; P=3x10-8). This was comparable to findings from traditional observational studies (prevalence odds ratio 0.73, 0.68 to 0.78; incidence odds ratio 0.80, 0.76 to 0.83). Sensitivity analyses were consistent with a causal interpretation in which major bias from genetic pleiotropy was unlikely, although this remains an untestable possibility. Genetic predisposition towards longer education was additionally associated with less smoking, lower body mass index, and a favourable blood lipid profile.Conclusions This mendelian randomisation study found support for the hypothesis that low education is a causal risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease. Potential mechanisms could include smoking, body mass index, and blood lipids. In conjunction with the results from studies with other designs, these findings suggest that increasing education may result in substantial health benefits.

AB  - Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of experiencing cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction and stroke. Current observational data suggest that body mass index may have a causal role in the etiology of hypertension, but this may be influenced by confounding and reverse causation. Through the use of instrumental variable methods, we aim to estimate the strength of the unconfounded and unbiased association between body mass index/adiposity and blood pressure. We explore these issues in the Copenhagen General Population Study. We used instrumental variable methods to obtain estimates of the causal association between body mass index and blood pressure. This was performed using both rs9939609 (FTO) and rs17782313 (MC4R) genotypes as instruments for body mass index. Avoiding the epidemiological problems of confounding, bias, and reverse causation, we confirmed observational associations between body mass index and blood pressure. In analyses including those taking antihypertensive drugs, but for whom appropriate adjustment had been made, systolic blood pressure was seen to increase by 3.85 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.88 to 5.83 mm Hg) for each 10% increase in body mass index (P=0.0002), with diastolic blood pressure showing an increase of 1.79 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.68 to 2.90 mm Hg) for each 10% increase in body mass index (P=0.002). Observed associations are large and illustrate the considerable benefits in terms of reductions in blood pressure-related morbidity that could be achieved through a reduction in body mass index.

AB  - Background: Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with the metabolic syndrome and might be causally linked to it. Our aim was to generate estimates of the association between plasma CRP and metabolic syndrome phenotypes that were free from confounding and reverse causation, to assess the causal role of this protein. Methods: We examined associations between serum CRP concentration and metabolic syndrome phenotypes in the British Women's Heart and Health Study. We then compared these estimates with those derived from a mendelian randomised framework with common CRP gene haplotypes to generate unconfounded and unbiased estimates of any causal associations. Findings: In a sample of British women, body-mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and insulin resistance were all associated with plasma CRP concentration. CRP haplotypes were associated with plasma CRP concentration (p<0.0001). With instrumental variable analyses, there was no association between plasma CRP concentration and any of the metabolic syndrome phenotypes analysed. There was strong evidence that linear regression and mendelian randomisation based estimation gave conflicting results for the CRP-BMI association (p=0.0002), and some evidence of conflicting results for the association of CRP with the score for insulin resistance (p=0.0139), triglycerides (p=0.0313), and HDL cholesterol (p=0.0688). Interpretation: Disparity between estimates of the association between plasma CRP and phenotypes comprising the metabolic syndrome derived from conventional analyses and those from a mendelian randomisation approach suggests that there is no causal association between CRP and the metabolic syndrome phenotypes.

AB  - CONTEXT: The assignment of direction and causality within networks of observational associations is problematic outside randomized control trials, and the presence of a causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and C-reactive protein (CRP) is disputed., OBJECTIVE: Using reciprocal Mendelian randomization, we aim to assess the direction of causality in relationships between BMI and CRP and to demonstrate this as a promising analytical technique., PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The study was based on a large, cross-sectional European study from Copenhagen, Denmark. Genetic associates of BMI (FTO(rs9939609)) and circulating CRP (CRP(rs3091244)) have been used to reexamine observational associations between them., RESULTS: Observational analyses showed a strong, positive association between circulating CRP and BMI (change in BMI for a doubling in log CRP of 1.03 kg m(-2) (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.00, 1.07), P<0.0001). Analysis using CRP(rs3091244) to re-estimate the causal effect of circulating CRP on BMI yielded null effects (change in BMI for a doubling in log CRP of -0.24 kg m(-2) (95% CI: -0.58, 0.11), P=0.2). In contrast, analysis using FTO(rs9939609) to assess the causal effect of BMI on circulating CRP confirmed observational associations (ratio of geometric means of CRP per s.d. increase in BMI 1.41 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.80), P=0.006)., CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that the observed association between circulating CRP and measured BMI is likely to be driven by BMI, with CRP being a marker of elevated adiposity. More generally, the method of reciprocal randomization has general applicability in determining the direction of causation within inter-correlated networks of metabolic components.

AB  - Fat mass may be a causal determinant of bone mass, but the evidence is conflicting, possibly reflecting the influence of confounding factors. The recent identification of common genetic variants related to obesity in children provides an opportunity to implement a Mendelian randomization study of obesity and bone outcomes, which is less subject to confounding and several biases than conventional approaches. Genotyping was retrieved for variants of two loci reliably associated with adiposity (the fat mass and obesity-related gene FTO and that upstream of the MC4R locus) within 7470 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who had undergone total body DXA scans at a mean of 9.9 yr. Relationships between both fat mass/genotypes and bone measures were assessed in efforts to determine evidence of causality between adiposity and bone mass. In conventional tests of association, both with and without height adjustment, total fat mass was strongly related to total body, spinal, and upper and lower limb BMC (ratio of geometric means [RGM]: 1.118 [95% CI: 1.112, 1.123], 1.110 [95% CI: 1.102, 1.119], 1.101 [95% CI: 1.093, 1.108], 1.146 [95% CI: 1.143, 1.155]; p < 10(-10) [adjusted for sex, height, and sitting height]). Equivalent or larger effects were obtained from instrumental variable (IV) regression including the same covariates (1.139 [95% CI: 1.064, 1.220], 1.090 [95% CI: 1.010, 1.177], 1.142 [95% CI: 1.049, 1.243], 1.176 [95% CI: 1.099, 1.257]; p = 0.0002, 0.03, 0.002, and 2.3(-6) respectively). Similar results were obtained after adjusting for puberty, when truncal fat mass was used in place of total fat, and when bone area was used instead of bone mass. In analyses where total body BMC adjusted for bone area (BA) was the outcome (reflecting volumetric BMD), linear regression with fat mass showed evidence for association (1.004 [95% CI: 1.002, 1.007], p = 0.0001). IV regression also showed a positive effect (1.031 [95% CI: 1.000, 1.062], p = 0.05). When MC4R and FTO markers were used as instruments for fat mass, similar associations with BMC were seen to those with fat mass as measured by DXA. This suggests that fat mass is on the causal pathway for bone mass in children. In addition, both directly assessed and IV-assessed relationships between fat mass and volumetric density showed evidence for positive effects, supporting a hypothesis that fat effects on bone mass are not entirely accounted for by association with overall bone size.

AB  - Obesity has been posited as an independent risk factor for diabetic kidney disease (DKD); however, epidemiologic studies have produced conflicting results, and establishing causality from observational data is difficult. Because obesity has a strong heritable component (heritability estimates ranging 40-70%), a Mendelian randomization approach, which exploits the random assortment of gene variants during meiosis, can be leveraged to assess the causal nature of obesity on the development of DKD. We used a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) as an instrument to test the relationship of body mass index (BMI) with DKD, using 32 loci associated with BMI and weighting each risk allele by its published effect size, in each of 3 cohorts of participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with and without DKD (n=6049). The GRS was significantly associated with BMI in all 3 cohorts (increase of 1.62 kg/m2 per average risk allele, P< 0.001). BMI was not significantly associated with DKD in any of the 3 cohorts (combined odds ratio [OR] for an increase of 1 kg/m2 in BMI, 1.00, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.01, P=0.19). However, each 1 kg/m2 in BMI due to GRS was significantly associated with increased risk of DKD in all 3 cohorts (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.08, P=0.001). We also investigated the impact of BMI on DKD subtypes. Higher BMI was associated with risk of macroalbuminuria by both observational epidemiology (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.02, P<0.001) and GRS (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.08, P=0.001). In contrast, for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there was a lower risk for each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI from observational epidemiology (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 - 0.99, P<0.001), and a trend toward an increased risk of ESRD in 2 of 3 cohorts with higher BMI by GRS (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.04, P=0.069). In conclusion, genetic factors associated with increased BMI raise the risk of DKD even in the context of T1D, suggesting a causal link between obesity and DKD. As obesity prevalence rises in people with T1D, this finding predicts an increase in DKD in this population unless intervened upon.

AB  - Obesity has been posited as an independent risk factor for diabetic kidney disease (DKD), but establishing causality from observational data is problematic. We aimed to test whether obesity is causally related to DKD using Mendelian randomization, which exploits the random assortment of genes during meiosis. In 6,049 subjects with type 1 diabetes, we used a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) comprised of 32 validated BMI loci as an instrument to test the relationship of BMI with macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or DKD defined as presence of macroalbuminuria or ESRD. We compared these results with cross-sectional and longitudinal observational associations. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated a U-shaped relationship of BMI with development of macroalbuminuria, ESRD, or DKD over time. Cross-sectional observational analysis showed no association with overall DKD, higher odds of macroalbuminuria (for every 1 kg/m(2) higher BMI, odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, P < 0.001), and lower odds of ESRD (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.97, P < 0.001). Mendelian randomization analysis showed a 1 kg/m(2) higher BMI conferring an increased risk in macroalbuminuria (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.11-1.45, P = 0.001), ESRD (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.72, P < 0.001), and DKD (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17-1.51, P < 0.001). Our results provide genetic evidence for a causal link between obesity and DKD in type 1 diabetes. As obesity prevalence rises, this finding predicts an increase in DKD prevalence unless intervention should occur. Copyright © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Higher BMI and obesity are driving the epidemic of type 2 diabetes. In addition to biological factors, social and economic factors influence susceptibility to obesity, with people from poorer backgrounds having a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and premature mortality. Poverty and lower education status are thought to lead to poorer lifestyles and obesity, but there is limited evidence to suggest that higher BMI could lead directly to poverty and poorer lifestyle through, for example, discrimination against overweight individuals. We aimed to determine if BMI can directly influence socioeconomic status (SES). We used 119,669 individuals from the UK Biobank study and a Mendelian randomisation approach to test for causal effects of differences in BMI on five measures of SES: age completed full time education, degree level education, job class, annual household income and Townsend deprivation index (TDI). Higher BMI was observationally associated with several measures of lower SES. The associations between higher BMI and lower job class, household income and TDI were stronger in women than men. For example, a 1 SD higher BMI was associated with a 210 ([95% CI:84, 420], p=6x10-3) lower annual household income in men and a 1,890 ([95% CI:1,680, 2,100], p=6x10-106) lower annual household income in women. Genetic analysis provided evidence that these associations were partly causal. A genetically determined 1 SD higher BMI (4.6 kgm-2) caused a 2,940 ([95% CI:1,680, 4, 200] p=1x10-5) lower annual household income and a 0.10 SD ([95% CI:0.04, 0.16] p=0.001) higher level of deprivation in women but there was no evidence for an effect in men. These data support evidence that high BMI plays an important partial role in determining several aspects of an individual's SES, especially women's BMI for income and deprivation. These findings have important social and health implications, supporting evidence that overweight individuals, especially women, are at a disadvantage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether height and body mass index (BMI) have a causal role in five measures of socioeconomic status., DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation study to test for causal effects of differences in stature and BMI on five measures of socioeconomic status. Mendelian randomisation exploits the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at conception and thus not confounded by non-genetic factors., SETTING: UK Biobank., PARTICIPANTS: 119,669 men and women of British ancestry, aged between 37 and 73 years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age completed full time education, degree level education, job class, annual household income, and Townsend deprivation index., RESULTS: In the UK Biobank study, shorter stature and higher BMI were observationally associated with several measures of lower socioeconomic status. The associations between shorter stature and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in men, and the associations between higher BMI and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in women. For example, a 1 standard deviation (SD) higher BMI was associated with a 210 (276; $300; 95% confidence interval 84 to 420; P=6 x 10(-3)) lower annual household income in men and a 1890 (1680 to 2100; P=6 x 10(-15)) lower annual household income in women. Genetic analysis provided evidence that these associations were partly causal. A genetically determined 1 SD (6.3 cm) taller stature caused a 0.06 (0.02 to 0.09) year older age of completing full time education (P=0.01), a 1.12 (1.07 to 1.18) times higher odds of working in a skilled profession (P=6 x 10(-7)), and a 1130 (680 to 1580) higher annual household income (P=4 x 10(-8)). Associations were stronger in men. A genetically determined 1 SD higher BMI (4.6 kg/m(2)) caused a 2940 (1680 to 4200; P=1 x 10(-5)) lower annual household income and a 0.10 (0.04 to 0.16) SD (P=0.001) higher level of deprivation in women only., CONCLUSIONS: These data support evidence that height and BMI play an important partial role in determining several aspects of a person's socioeconomic status, especially women's BMI for income and deprivation and men's height for education, income, and job class. These findings have important social and health implications, supporting evidence that overweight people, especially women, are at a disadvantage and that taller people, especially men, are at an advantage.

AB  - Background: Depression is more common in obese than non-obese individuals, especially in women, but the causal relationship between obesity and depression is complex and uncertain. Previous studies have used genetic variants associated with BMI to provide evidence that higher body mass index (BMI) causes depression, but have not tested whether this relationship is driven by the metabolic consequences of BMI nor for differences between men and women., Methods: We performed a Mendelian randomization study using 48 791 individuals with depression and 291 995 controls in the UK Biobank, to test for causal effects of higher BMI on depression (defined using self-report and Hospital Episode data). We used two genetic instruments, both representing higher BMI, but one with and one without its adverse metabolic consequences, in an attempt to 'uncouple' the psychological component of obesity from the metabolic consequences. We further tested causal relationships in men and women separately, and using subsets of BMI variants from known physiological pathways., Results: Higher BMI was strongly associated with higher odds of depression, especially in women. Mendelian randomization provided evidence that higher BMI partly causes depression. Using a 73-variant BMI genetic risk score, a genetically determined one standard deviation (1 SD) higher BMI (4.9 kg/m2) was associated with higher odds of depression in all individuals [odds ratio (OR): 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.28, P = 0.00007) and women only (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.39, P = 0.0001). Meta-analysis with 45 591 depression cases and 97 647 controls from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) strengthened the statistical confidence of the findings in all individuals. Similar effect size estimates were obtained using different Mendelian randomization methods, although not all reached P < 0.05. Using a metabolically favourable adiposity genetic risk score, and meta-analysing data from the UK biobank and PGC, a genetically determined 1 SD higher BMI (4.9 kg/m2) was associated with higher odds of depression in all individuals (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.50], P = 0.010), but with weaker statistical confidence., Conclusions: Higher BMI, with and without its adverse metabolic consequences, is likely to have a causal role in determining the likelihood of an individual developing depression.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Neonates born to overweight or obese women are larger and at higher risk of birth complications. Many maternal obesity-related traits are observationally associated with birth weight, but the causal nature of these associations is uncertain. OBJECTIVE To test for genetic evidence of causal associations of maternal body mass index (BMI) and related traits with birth weight. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Mendelian randomization to test whether maternal BMI and obesity-related traits are potentially causally related to offspring birth weight. Data from 30 487 women in 18 studies were analyzed. Participants were of European ancestry from population-or community-based studies in Europe, North America, or Australia and were part of the Early Growth Genetics Consortium. Live, term, singleton offspring born between 1929 and 2013 were included. EXPOSURES Genetic scores for BMI, fasting glucose level, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level, vitamin D status, and adiponectin level. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Offspring birthweight from 18 studies. RESULTS Among the 30 487 newborns the mean birth weight in the various cohorts ranged from 3325 g to 3679 g. The maternal genetic score for BMI was associated with a 2-g (95%CI, 0 to 3 g) higher offspring birth weight per maternal BMI-raising allele (P = .008). The maternal genetic scores for fasting glucose and SBP were also associated with birth weight with effect sizes of 8 g (95%CI, 6 to 10 g) per glucose-raising allele (P = 7 x 10-14) and -4 g (95%CI, -6 to -2g) per SBP-raising allele (P = 1x10-5), respectively. A 1-SD ( = 4 points) genetically higher maternal BMI was associated with a 55-g higher offspring birth weight (95%CI, 17 to 93 g). A 1-SD ( = 7.2mg/dL) genetically higher maternal fasting glucose concentration was associated with 114-g higher offspring birth weight (95%CI, 80 to 147 g). However, a 1-SD ( = 10mmHg) genetically higher maternal SBP was associated with a 208-g lower offspring birth weight (95%CI, -394 to -21 g). For BMI and fasting glucose, genetic associations were consistent with the observational associations, but for systolic blood pressure, the genetic and observational associations were in opposite directions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this mendelian randomization study, genetically elevated maternal BMI and blood glucose levels were potentially causally associated with higher offspring birth weight, whereas genetically elevated maternal SBP was potentially causally related to lower birth weight. If replicated, these findings may have implications for counseling and managing pregnancies to avoid adverse weight-related birth outcomes.Copyright 2016 American Medical Association.

AB  - Epidemiological studies show that type 2 diabetes (T2D) is inversely associated with intracranial aneurysms (IA) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Although adiposity has not been considered a risk factor for IA, there have been inconsistent reports relating adiposity to AAA risk. We assessed whether these observations have a genetic, causal basis. To this end, we extracted genotypes of validated single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with T2D (n=65), body mass index (BMI) (n=97) and waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) (n=47) from genotype data collected in 717 IA cases and 1988 controls, and in 818 AAA cases and 3004 controls, all of Dutch descent. For each of these three traits, we computed genetic risk scores (GRS) for each individual in these case-control data sets by summing the number of risk alleles weighted by their published effect size, and tested whether these GRS were associated with risk of aneurysm. We divided the cohorts into GRS quartiles, and compared IA and AAA risk in the highest with the lowest GRS quartile using logistic regression. We found no evidence for association in IA or AAA risk between top and bottom quartiles for the genetic risk scores for T2D, BMI and WHRadjBMI. However, additional Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a trend to potentially causal associations between BMI and WHRadjBMI and risk of AAA. Overall, our results do not support epidemiological observations relating T2D to aneurysm risk, but may indicate a potential role of adiposity in AAA that requires further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) is correlated negatively with subjective well-being and positively with depressive symptoms. Whether these associations reflect causal effects is unclear., METHODS: We examined bidirectional, causal effects between BMI and mental health with Mendelian randomisation using summary-level data from published genome-wide association studies (BMI: n=339 224; subjective well-being: n=204 966; depressive symptoms: n=161 460). Genetic variants robustly related to the exposure variable acted as instrumental variable to estimate causal effects. We combined estimates of individual genetic variants with inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, weighted median regression and MR-Egger regression., RESULTS: There was evidence for a causal, increasing effect of BMI on depressive symptoms and suggestive evidence for a decreasing effect of BMI on subjective well-being. We found no evidence for causality in the other direction., CONCLUSION: This study provides support for a higher BMI causing poorer mental health. Further research should corroborate these findings and explore mechanisms underlying this potential causality.

AB  - Background: An inverse association between birth weight and the risk of developing attention problems in childhood has been reported repeatedly. However, this association could be subject to confounding. Mendelian randomization, in which genetic variants are used as a surrogate for measuring the exposure, is an approach which may help better understand this association. Aim: To assess the causal nature of the observed association between reduced birth weight and risk of attention problems in childhood. Methods: In a population-based birth cohort, birth weight was assessed in 2,141 children of north-European descent. Child attention problems at age 6 were assessed by parental report with the Child Behavioural Checklist. From previous meta-analyses of genome wide analysis, we identified 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that predict birth weight. First, we examined the association between birth weight and attention problems and corrected for potential confounders. Second, we used regression models to examine the associations between child birth weght and behavioural problems. Next, joint significance of the selected SNPs on birth weight and childhood attention problems were analysed using F-statistics. Results: Low birth weight corrected for gestational age was not associated with attention problems. We observed a curvilinear association between birth weight and attention problems that remained after adjustment (beta 0.02 95%CI 0.00; 0.05, P=0.04). The negative association between birth weight below the turning point was reduced after correction for numerous confounders. Selected SNPs associated with birth weight (F: 3.098, P<0.001) significantly predicted problems of attention (F: 1.743, P=0.04). However, the directions of the effects were not consistent and this association was therefore not explained by birth weight. Conclusion: The association between birth weight and attention problems is subject to confounding. Genetic variants associated with birth weight were significantly associated with attention problems but our observations suggest a potential pleiotrophic effect of the selected SNPs. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying this association.

AB  - Inflammation is endemic to obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) but it is unclear if it is a cause or a consequence. If the latter, then inflammation may increase the risk of obesity and diabetes complications. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of inflammation and cardiometabolic traits can be used to investigate causal mechanisms. Summary statistics were assembled from GWAS of 49 cytokine (N=840-80,000) and 20 cardiometabolic traits (N=2,447-465,333). Shared genetic background was measured using LD score regression. Polygenic scores (PGS) were generated from GWAS data for 49 cytokines (representing inflammation) and 20 cardiometabolic traits and used in two-way Mendelian Randomisation (MR) analyses. Causal relationships were identified using summary statistics for all traits, and individual data (UK Biobank, N=465,333) to test the association of cytokine PGS with body mass index (BMI) and T2D. LD score regression analysis demonstrated that BMI and T2D shared a genetic background with acute phase cytokines. However, MR analyses showed that genetically-driven variation in cytokine levels were not associated with increased BMI or T2D risk. This argues against a causal role for inflammation (as represented by these cytokines) in the development of obesity and T2D. In contrast, genetically driven obesity was associated with increased inflammation: a PGS for increased BMI was associated with increased C-reactive protein (Beta [95% CI], 0.40 [0.34,0.46], p=1.3x10-36) and activated plasminogen inhibitor (Beta [95% CI], 0.39 [0.19, 0.59], p=7.8x10-5) levels. Genetically-driven variation in cytokine levels were causally linked with chronic kidney disease in subjects with T2D: fibroblast growth factor 2 (OR[95% CI], 0.58[0.46,0.72], p=1.8x10-6) and interleukin 13 (OR[95% CI], 1.28[1.15,1.43], p=7.0x10-6) We conclude that chronic inflammation is a consequence, rather than a cause, of T2D and obesity, and may contribute to some of their complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with vitamin D deficiency, and both are areas of active public health concern. We explored the causality and direction of the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] using genetic markers as instrumental variables (IVs) in bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used information from 21 adult cohorts (up to 42,024 participants) with 12 BMI-related SNPs (combined in an allelic score) to produce an instrument for BMI and four SNPs associated with 25(OH)D (combined in two allelic scores, separately for genes encoding its synthesis or metabolism) as an instrument for vitamin D. Regression estimates for the IVs (allele scores) were generated within-study and pooled by meta-analysis to generate summary effects. Associations between vitamin D scores and BMI were confirmed in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium (n = 123,864). Each 1 kg/m(2) higher BMI was associated with 1.15% lower 25(OH)D (p = 6.52x10-27). The BMI allele score was associated both with BMI (p = 6.30x10-62) and 25(OH)D (-0.06% [95% CI -0.10 to -0.02], p = 0.004) in the cohorts that underwent meta-analysis. The two vitamin D allele scores were strongly associated with 25(OH)D (p<=8.07x10-57 for both scores) but not with BMI (synthesis score, p = 0.88; metabolism score, p = 0.08) in the meta-analysis. A 10% higher genetically instrumented BMI was associated with 4.2% lower 25(OH)D concentrations (IV ratio: -4.2 [95% CI -7.1 to -1.3], p = 0.005). No association was seen for genetically instrumented 25(OH)D with BMI, a finding that was confirmed using data from the GIANT consortium (p>=0.57 for both vitamin D scores)., CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a bi-directional genetic approach that limits confounding, our study suggests that a higher BMI leads to lower 25(OH)D, while any effects of lower 25(OH)D increasing BMI are likely to be small. Population level interventions to reduce BMI are expected to decrease the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of the causal relationship between BMI and mortality., METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) with BMI-associated genotypic variation was used to test the causal effect of BMI on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in UK Biobank participants of White British ancestry., RESULTS: MR analyses supported a causal association between higher BMI and greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 kg/m2 : 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99-1.07) and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01-1.19), specifically coronary heart disease (HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.00-1.25) and those excluding coronary heart disease/stroke/aortic aneurysm (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.03-1.48), stomach cancer (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.87-1.62), and esophageal cancer (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.98-1.53), and a decreased risk of lung cancer mortality (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.85-1.08). Sex stratification supported the causal role of higher BMI increasing bladder cancer mortality risk (males) but decreasing respiratory disease mortality risk (males). The J-shaped observational association between BMI and mortality was visible with MR analyses, but the BMI at which mortality was minimized was lower and the association was flatter over a larger BMI range., CONCLUSIONS: Results support a causal role of higher BMI in increasing the risk of all-cause mortality and mortality from several specific causes.

AB  - Objective: Obtain estimates of the causal relationship between different levels of body mass index (BMI) and mortality. Methods: Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted using genotypic variation reliably associated with BMI to test the causal effect of increasing BMI on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in participants of White British ancestry in UK Biobank. Results: MR analyses supported existing evidence for a causal association between higher levels of BMI and greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) per 1kg/m2: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.97,1.06) and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.23), specifically coronary heart disease (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.35) and those other than stroke/aortic aneurysm (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.38), stomach cancer (HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.86) and oesophageal cancer (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.38), and with decreased risk of lung cancer mortality (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.11). Sex-stratified analyses supported a causal role of higher BMI in increasing the risk of mortality from bladder cancer in males and other causes in females, but in decreasing the risk of respiratory disease mortality in males. The characteristic J-shaped observational association between BMI and mortality was visible with MR analyses but with a smaller value of BMI at which mortality risk was lowest and apparently flatter over a larger range of BMI. Conclusion: Results support a causal role of higher BMI in increasing the risk of all-cause mortality and mortality from other causes. However, studies with greater numbers of deaths are needed to confirm the current findings.

AB  - Background: Body mass index (BMI) has been suggested to be causally related to cardiovascular health in mid-to-late life, but this has not been explored systematically at younger ages - nor with detailed cardiovascular phenotyping. Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) is an approach that enables the collection of precise phenotypic measures in smaller studies, whilst maintaining statistical power and ability for causal inference., Methods: In this study, we used a combination of conventional multivariable regression analysis, Mendelian randomization (MR) and sub-sample RbG methodologies to estimate the causal effect of BMI on gross-level and detailed cardiovascular health in healthy participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17 (N=1420-3108 for different outcomes) and an independent sample from the same cohort (for RbG) study at age 21 (N=386-418)., Results: In both MR and RbG analyses, results suggested that higher BMI causes higher blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in young adults (e.g., difference in LVMI per kg/m2 using MR: 1.07g/m2.7; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.52; P=3.87x10-06 and per 3.58kg/m2 using RbG: 1.65g/m2.7 95% CI: 0.83, 2.47; P=0.0001). Additionally, RbG results suggested a causal role of higher BMI on higher stroke volume (SV: difference per 3.58kg/m2: 1.49ml/m2.04; 95% CI: 0.62, 2.35; P=0.001) and cardiac output (CO: difference per 3.58kg/m2: 0.11l/min/m1.83; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.19; P=0.01) but no strong evidence for a causal role on systemic vascular resistance or total arterial compliance. Neither analysis supported a causal role of higher BMI on heart rate., Conclusions: Complementary MR and RbG causal methodologies, together with a range of sensitivity analyses, suggest that higher BMI is likely to cause worse cardiovascular health, specifically higher BP and LVMI, even in youth. Higher BMI also resulted in increased CO in the RbG study, which appeared to be solely driven by SV, as neither MR nor RbG analyses suggested a causal effect of BMI on heart rate. These consistent results support efforts to reduce BMI from a young age to prevent later adverse cardiovascular health and illustrate the potential for phenotypic resolution with maintained analytical power using RbG.

AB  - Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) studies of body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular health in mid-to-late life suggest causal relationships, but the nature of these has not been explored systematically at younger ages. Using complementary MR and recall-by-genotype (RbG) methodologies, our objective was to estimate the causal effect of BMI on detailed measures of cardiovascular health in a population of young healthy adults. Methods and Findings: Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used. For MR analyses, a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising 97 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and constructed using external weighting was used as an instrument to test the causal effect of each unit increase in BMI (kg/m2) on selected cardiovascular phenotypes measured at age 17 (N=7909). An independent enriched sample from the same cohort participated in a RbG study at age 21, which enabled more detailed cardiovascular phenotyping (N=418; 191/227 from the lower/upper ~30% of a genome-wide GRS distribution predicting variation in BMI). The causal effect of BMI on the additional cardiovascular phenotypes was assessed by comparing the two recalled groups. Difference in mean BMI between RbG groups was 3.85kg/m2 (95% CI: 2.53, 4.63; P=6.09x10-11). In both MR and RbG analyses, results indicated that higher BMI causes higher blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass (indexed to height2.7, LVMI) in young adults (e.g. difference in LVMI per kg/m2 using MR: 1.07g/m2.7; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.52; P=3.87x10-06 and per 3.58kg/m2 using RbG: 1.65g/m2.7 95% CI: 0.83, 2.47; P=0.0001). Additionally, RbG results indicated a causal role of higher BMI on higher stroke volume (SV; difference per 3.58kg/m2: 1.49ml/m2.04; 95% CI: 0.62, 2.35; P=0.001) and cardiac output (CO; difference per 3.58kg/m2: 0.11l/min/m1.83; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.19; P=0.01). Neither analysis supported a causal role of higher BMI on heart rate. Conclusions: Complementary MR and RbG causal methodologies, together with a range of appropriate sensitivity analyses, showed that higher BMI is likely to cause worse cardiovascular health, specifically higher BP and LVMI, even in youth. These consistent results support efforts to prevent or reverse obesity in the young.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and anxiety are often linked but the direction of effects is not clear., METHOD: Using genetic instrumental variable (IV) analyses in 5911 female participants from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, initiated 1976) and 3697 male participants from the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS, initiated 1986), we aimed to determine whether obesity increases symptoms of phobic anxiety. As instrumental variables we used the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene and a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that significantly predict body mass index (BMI). 'Functional' GRSs corresponding with specific biological pathways that shape BMI (adipogenesis, appetite and cardiopulmonary) were considered. The main outcome was phobic anxiety measured by the Crown Crisp Index (CCI) in 2004 in the NHS and in 2000 in the HPFS., RESULTS: In observational analysis, a 1-unit higher BMI was associated with higher phobic anxiety symptoms [women: beta = 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.030-0.068; men: beta = 0.04, 95% CI 0.016-0.071). IV analyses showed that BMI was associated with higher phobic anxiety symptoms in the FTO-instrumented analysis (p = 0.005) but not in the GRS-instrumented analysis (p = 0.256). Functional GRSs showed heterogeneous, non-significant effects of BMI on phobic anxiety symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not provide conclusive evidence in favor of the hypothesis that higher BMI leads to higher levels of phobic anxiety, but rather suggest that genes that influence obesity, in particular FTO, may have direct effects on phobic anxiety, and hence that obesity and phobic anxiety may share common genetic determinants.

AB  - Mendelian Randomization studies, which use genetic instrumental variables (IVs) as quasi-experiments to estimate causal effects, report inconsistent findings regarding effects of body mass index (BMI) on mental health. We used genetic IV to estimate effects of BMI on depression and evaluated validity of a commonly used IV. Female Nurse's Health Study participants (n=6989, average age 56.4, [Standard Deviation 6.91] years at first depression assessment) self-reported BMI, which was averaged across eight reports prior to depression assessment (mean=24.96, SD 4.50). Genetic instruments included fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) alleles, melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) alleles, and polygenic risk scores based on 32 established polymorphisms for BMI. Depression was assessed using multiple symptom measures, scaled to the Geriatric Depression Scale 15, averaged across up to 7 biennial waves. We used over-identification tests to assess the validity of genetic IVs. In conventional estimates, each additional BMI point predicted 0.024 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.020-0.029) higher average depression scores. Genetic IV estimates were not significant when based on FTO (beta: 0.064, CI: -0.014, 0.142), MC4R (beta: 0.005, CI: -0.146, 0.156), polygenic score excluding FTO (beta=-0.003, 95%-CI -0.051, 0.045), or mechanism-specific scores. The over-identification test comparing IV estimates based on FTO to estimates based on the polygenic score excluding FTO rejected equality of estimated effects (P=0.014). Results provide no evidence against a null effect of BMI on depression and call into question validity of FTO as an instrument for BMI in Mendelian Randomization studies.

AB  - Background: The relationship between adiposity and mental health remains controversial despite extensive prior observational research. We use a genetic risk score (GRS) as an instrumental variable (IV) to estimate effects of increases in body mass index (BMI) on depressive symptoms. Methods: Data are from 11842 (whites = 10322, blacks = 1520) individuals from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study with data on a 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale and genetics collected in 2006 or 2008. Based on 32 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) known to predict BMI, we calculated a GRS as the sum of the number of risk alleles multiplied by the per allele effect size on BMI (based on prior publications).We conducted over-identification tests with 4 IVs using subsets of the SNPs organized based on biological pathways (adiposity, appetite, and cardio-pulmonary factors) by which the genes might influence adiposity. Self-reported BMI prior to the assessment of CESD was used for validation of the external instrument. The CESD score was regressed on each genetic IV plus population stratification eigenvectors to derive the IV effect estimate. We compared these to conventional effect estimates derived from regressing CESD on self-reported BMI. Results: The GRS significantly predicted BMI in blacks (r2 = 0.016, p < 0.001) and whites (r2 = 0.010, p < 0.001). Self-reported BMI significantly predicted CESD, more strongly in whites (0.043, 95%-CI: 0.036, 0.05) than blacks (0.021, CI: 0.004, 0.038). IV effect estimates were large and statistically significant for whites (0.096, CI: 0.026, 0.167) but had very wide CIs for blacks (0.016, CI: -0.224, 0.256). Over-identification tests showed no evidence of possible pleiotropy in the genetic risk score. Conclusions: Our IV analysis reveals that genotypes associated with BMI are also associated with depressive symptoms in whites, supporting a causal effect of BMI on depression.

AB  - Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) affects 10-20% of the population and is associated with substantial functional deficits. We identified 42 loci for self-reported EDS in GWAS of 452,071 individuals from the UK Biobank, with enrichment for genes expressed in brain tissues and in neuronal transmission pathways. We confirmed the aggregate effect of a genetic risk score of 42 SNPs on EDS in independent Scandinavian cohorts and on other sleep disorders (restless leg syndrome, insomnia) and sleep traits (duration, chronotype, accelerometer-derived sleep efficiency and daytime naps or inactivity). Strong genetic correlations were also seen with obesity, coronary heart disease, psychiatric diseases, cognitive traits and reproductive ageing. EDS variants clustered into two predominant composite phenotypes - sleep propensity and sleep fragmentation - with the former showing stronger evidence for enriched expression in central nervous system tissues, suggesting two unique mechanistic pathways. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated that higher BMI is causally associated with EDS risk, but EDS does not appear to causally influence BMI.

AB  - Context: Type 2 diabetes and obesity often coexist, so it is difficult to judge whether diabetes or obesity induce certain types of hyperlipidemia due to mutual confounds and reverse causation. We used Mendelian randomization analyses to explore the causal relationships of diabetes and adiposity with lipid profiles., Design, Setting, and Main Outcome Measures: From 23 sites in East China, 9798 participants were enrolled during 2014 to 2016. We calculated two weighted genetic risk scores as instrumental variables for type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI). These scores were used to measure the causal relationships of diabetes and BMI with lipid profiles that included total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs)., Results: The causal regression coefficients (betaIV) of genetically determined diabetes for the total cholesterol, LDL-C, and log10TG were 0.130 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.020, 0.240; P = 0.014], 0.125 (96% CI: 0.041, 0.209; P = 0.001), and 0.019 (95% CI: -0.001, 0.039; P = 0.055), respectively. The betaIV for HDL-C was -0.008 (95% CI: -0.032. 0.016), which was not significant (P = 0.699). The causal regression coefficients of a genetically determined 10 kg/m2 increase in BMI for HDL-C and log10TG were -0.409 (96% CI: -0.698, -0.120; P = 0.004) and 0.227 (95% CI: 0.039, 0.415; P = 0.026), respectively. The betaIVs for TGs and LDL-C were not significant., Conclusions: This study has provided evidence for the biologically plausible causal effects of diabetes and adiposity by BMI on different elements of the lipid profile using Mendelian randomization analyses.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis: Low birthweight has been associated with a high risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in observational studies. However, it remains unclear whether this relation is causal. Methods: The present study included 3627 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 12,974 control participants of European ancestry from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated based on five low-birthweight-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We assessed the evidence for causality first by examining the association of the GRS and the individual SNPs with type 2 diabetes, and second by performing a Mendelian randomisation analysis to estimate the potentially causal effect size of low birthweight on type 2 diabetes. Results: In a meta-analysis of the two studies, each 1 point increment in the GRS was associated with a 6% (95% CI 3%, 9%) higher risk of type 2 diabetes. CCNL1 rs900400 and 5q11.2 rs4432842 showed dose-response associations with risk of type 2 diabetes; the corresponding ORs and 95% CIs were 1.09 (1.03, 1.16) and 1.09 (1.02, 1.16), respectively. Furthermore, we observed an overall Mendelian randomisation OR of 2.94 (95% CI 1.70, 5.16; p < 0.001) for type 2 diabetes per 1 SD lower genetically determined birthweight. Conclusions/interpretation: A genetically lowered birthweight was associated with increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Our findings support a potential causal relation between birthweight and risk of type 2 diabetes, providing new evidence to support the role of intrauterine exposures in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background Clinical heterogeneity exists in overall obesity and central obesity in terms of susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, but the relationship is susceptible to be confounded by traditional risk factors (eg, population admixture and lipid concentration patterns) in epidemiology studies. We aimed to characterise the causal role of obesity in insulin sensitivity and secretion by using a Mendelian randomisation approach with genetic variants for measuring overall and abdominal obesity. Methods We constructed two genetic risk scores on the basis of 38 established loci for BMI (a surrogate of overall obesity) and 13 established loci for waist-to-hip ratio (a surrogate of abdominal obesity) in east Asian populations to assess the effects of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio on several glycaemic-related traits in community-based Han Chinese individuals. Patients with cancer, severe disability, or severe psychiatric disturbances were excluded. Ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital. Informed patient consent was given by all participants. The causal relationships between two types of obesity and the indices of insulin secretion and sensitivity (eg, homeostasis model assessments of beta-cell function and insulin resistance, Stumvoll first and second phase insulin secretion indices, and Gutt's insulin sensitivity index) were estimated with the framework of Mendelian randomisation analysis. Findings Between November, 2009 and February, 2012, we enrolled 2884 Han Chinese individuals aged between 34 years and 70 years. The mean BMI of the study participants was 24.42 (SD 3.35 kg/m2), and 46% of patients were men. Both BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were observationally correlated with insulin sensitivity and secretion indices. The Mendelian randomisation analysis showed that a genetically determined 1 SD (3.35 kg/m2) higher BMI caused a unit of 178.18 pmol/L higher Stumvoll first phase (95% CI 105.70-191.26, p=0.0012) and 35.52 pmol/L higher Stumvoll second phase insulin secretion (95% CI 20.00-91.74, p=0.0022), which were independent of abdominal obesity (p=0.019 in the Stumvoll first phase and p=0.039 in the Stumvoll second phase). By contrast, a genetically determined 1 SD higher waist-to-hip ratio (0.002 in waist-to-hip ratio) caused a unit of 1.21 higher homeostasis model assessments of insulin resistance (95% CI 0.01-2.41, p=0.048) and 18.40 lower Gutt insulin sensitivity index; 95% CI 1.91-35.02, p=0.028). No substantial heterogeneity existed between the observed association of BMI or waist-to-hip ratio with glycaemic-related traits and the association estimated by Mendelian randomisation analysis (pdifference>0.05). Interpretation Overall obesity might affect compensatory insulin secretion but abdominal obesity is inversely associated with insulin sensitivity in the Han Chinese population.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Clinical heterogeneity exists in overall obesity and obesity in terms of susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, but the relationship is vulnerable to be confounded by traditional risk factors in epidemiological studies. We aimed to characterize the impact of obesity in insulin secretion and sensitivity by using Mendelian randomization (MR) approach with genetic variants., SUBJECTS/METHODS: We first constructed two genetic risk scores based on 38 established loci for body mass index (BMI; a surrogate of overall obesity) and 13 waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; a surrogate of central obesity) to assess the causal effects of BMI and WHR on several glycaemic-related traits in 2884 community-based Han Chinese individuals., RESULTS: Both of BMI and WHR were observationally correlated with insulin secretion and sensitivity indices. The MR analysis demonstrated that a genetically determined 1 s.d. (3.35 kg m-2) higher BMI caused a unit of 178.18 pmol l-1 higher Stumvoll first-phase and 35.52 pmol l-1 higher Stumvoll second-phase insulin secretion (P=0.001 and 0.002, respectively), which were even independent of central obesity (P=0.019 and 0.039, respectively). In contrast, a genetically determined 1 s.d. higher WHR (a change of 0.002 in WHR) caused a unit of 1.21 higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and 18.40 lower Gutt index (representing the insulin sensitivity) (P=0.048 and 0.028, respectively). No substantial heterogeneity existed between the observed associations and the genetic estimated associations (P for difference >0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: We provide new causal evidence that the impact of obesity on insulin secretion and sensitivity could vary between overall obesity and central obesity in Han Chinese populations and also identify the extent to which overall obesity affects compensatory insulin secretion and central obesity inversely links to insulin sensitivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the causal effect of overall obesity and abdominal obesity on type 2 diabetes among Chinese Han individuals., METHODS: The causal relationship of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with the risk of glucose deterioration and glycemic traits was compared using two different genetic instruments based on 30 BMI loci and 6 WHR loci with Mendelian randomization (MR) in three prospective cohorts (n = 6,476)., RESULTS: Each 1-SD genetically instrumented higher WHR was associated with a 65.7% higher risk of glucose deterioration (95% CI = 1.069-2.569, P = 0.024), whereas no significant association of BMI with glucose deterioration was observed. Furthermore, a causal relationship was found only between BMI and homeostatic model assessment beta-cell function (HOMA-B) (beta = 0.143, P = 0.001), and there was a nominal association with Stumvoll second-phase insulin secretion traits (beta = 0.074, P = 0.022). The significance level did not persist in sensitivity analyses, except in the causal estimate of WHR on the Gutt index in MR-Egger (beta = -0.379, P = 0.022) and the causal estimate of BMI on homeostatic model assessment beta-cell function in weighted median MR (beta = 0.128, P = 0.017)., CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study support the potential causal relationship between abdominal obesity and hyperglycemia, which may be driven by aggravated insulin resistance, in contrast with the potential causal relationship between overall obesity and insulin secretion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The causal effect of adipose tissue on bone mass and the direction of its net influence have not been directly assessed in adult humans. Using the Mendelian randomization analysis, we assessed the causality of adiposity in measurements of bone mass in adult males and females., DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects consisted of 2154 adults aged 25-54 years from a cross-sectional cohort of the employees of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. Body composition was determined after at least 3 h of fasting using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. A polymorphism in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO rs9939609) was used as an instrument in the Mendelian randomization analysis., RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was 61.1% TT, 33.9% AT and 5.0% AA. The average body mass index (BMI), body fat mass and percentage body fat were 23.9 kg/m(2) (SD = 3.6), 17.9 kg (SD = 6.6) and 26.8% (SD = 7.2), respectively. The FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was significantly correlated with BMI (coefficient = 0.673 kg/m(2) , P < 0.001), body fat mass (coefficient = 0.948 kg, P < 0.001) and percentage body fat (coefficient = 0.759%, P < 0.01). An instrumental variable (IV) regression model, using BMI as the intermediate phenotype, suggested that FTO was a strong IV. Also, the FTO-BMI polymorphism was significantly associated with total hip and femoral neck BMD but was not correlated with total spine BMD, with estimated correlation coefficients of 0.0189 (95% CI: 0.0046, 0.0332), 0.0149 (95% CI: 0.0030, 0.0268) and 0.0025 (95% CI: -0.0131, 0.0136) g/cm(2) , respectively. The variances of BMDs explained by the FTO-BMI were 19.0%, 21.3% and 1.1%, respectively. Similar trends were also observed for the FTO-body fat mass and FTO-percentage body fat correlations., CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analysis suggests that adiposity might be causally related to BMD at the femur but not at the spine.

AB  - The problem of the genetics of related phenotypes is often addressed by analyzing adjusted-model traits, but such traits warrant cautious interpretation. Here, we adopt a joint view of adiposity traits in ~322,154 subjects (GIANT consortium). We classify 159 signals associated with body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), or WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) at P < 5 x 10-8, into four classes based on the direction of their effects on BMI and WHR. Our classes help differentiate adiposity genetics with respect to anthropometry, fat depots, and metabolic health. Class-specific Mendelian randomization reveals that variants associated with both WHR-decrease and BMI increase are linked to metabolically rather favorable adiposity through beneficial hip fat. Class-specific enrichment analyses implicate digestive systems as a pathway in adiposity genetics. Our results demonstrate that WHRadjBMI variants capture relevant effects of "unexpected fat distribution given the BMI" and that a joint view of the genetics underlying related phenotypes can inform on important biology.

AB  - The genetics of related phenotypes is often tackled by analyzing adjusted model traits, which may be subject to statistical biases. Here, we developed a joint analysis and applied it to adiposity traits. Analyzing GIANT consortium data (up to 322,154 subjects), we identified 159 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly (P < 5x10-8) associated with at least one classical measures of obesity (body-mass-index (BMI), waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR), WHR adjusted for BMI). These variants were then classified into four groups according to their effect direction for BMI and WHR: increasing both BMI and WHR (via increased waist) [BMI+WHR+]; having opposite effect on BMI and WHR (via hip-increase) [BMI+WHR-]; being associated only with BMI (via proportional waist-and hip-increase) [BMI-only]; WHR-only (via waist-increase and hip-decrease). Deeper examination revealed that these classes represent meaningful genetic subgroups of obesity. First, BMI-only and BMI+WHR-classes impact mostly subcutaneous fat, while WHR-only SNPs change visceral/adipose fat ratio. Classspecific Mendelian randomization provided evidence that 1 SD (~4.5 kg/m2) of genetically increased BMI driven by waist-gain (via the 82 BMI+WHR+ variants) confers 2.5 higher odds for type 2 diabetes (T2D) (PMR = 5x10-29). However, when the same BMIincrease is coupled with hip-gain (via the 24 BMI+WHR-variants) it reduces the T2D odds by >80% (PMR = 7x10-12). Finally, tissue enrichment analyses (DEPICT, FUMA) implicate the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and sigmoid colon for the WHR-only subclass. Our results demonstrate that a joint view of related phenotypes genetics can unravel obesity sub-types with variable fat depots and vastly different metabolic health (lipids, coronary artery disease, T2D) consequences.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the association between subjective wellbeing (subjective happiness and life satisfaction) and cardiometabolic health is causal., DESIGN: Two sample, bidirectional mendelian randomisation study., SETTING: Genetic data taken from various cohorts comprised of the general population (mostly individuals of European ancestry, plus a small proportion of other ancestries); follow-up analysis included individuals from the United Kingdom., PARTICIPANTS: Summary data were used from previous genome wide association studies (number of participants ranging from 83 198 to 339 224), which investigated traits related to cardiovascular or metabolic health, had the largest sample sizes, and consisted of the most similar populations while minimising sample overlap. A follow-up analysis included 337 112 individuals from the UK Biobank (54% female (n=181 363), mean age 56.87 years (standard deviation 8.00) at recruitment)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjective wellbeing and 11 measures of cardiometabolic health (coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction; total, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol; diastolic and systolic blood pressure; body fat; waist to hip ratio; waist circumference; and body mass index)., RESULTS: Evidence of a causal effect of body mass index on subjective wellbeing was seen; each 1 kg/m2 increase in body mass index caused a -0.045 (95% confidence interval -0.084 to -0.006, P=0.02) standard deviation reduction in subjective wellbeing. Follow-up analysis of this association in an independent sample from the UK Biobank provided strong evidence of an effect of body mass index on satisfaction with health (beta=-0.035 unit decrease in health satisfaction (95% confidence interval -0.043 to -0.027) per standard deviation increase in body mass index, P<0.001). No clear evidence of a causal effect was seen between subjective wellbeing and the other cardiometabolic health measures, in either direction., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a higher body mass index is associated with a lower subjective wellbeing. A follow-up analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting that the effect in middle aged people could be driven by satisfaction with health. Body mass index is a modifiable determinant, and therefore, this study provides further motivation to tackle the obesity epidemic because of the knock-on effects of higher body mass index on subjective wellbeing.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether the association between subjective wellbeing (subjective happiness and life satisfaction) and physical health is causal. Design: We conducted two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomisation between subjective wellbeing and six measures of physical health: coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and body mass index (BMI). Participants: We used summary data from four large genome-wide association study consortia: CARDIoGRAMplusC4D for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction; the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium for cholesterol measures; the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits consortium for BMI; and the Social Science Genetics Association Consortium for subjective wellbeing. A replication analysis was conducted using 337,112 individuals from the UK Biobank (54% female, mean age =56.87, SD=8.00 years at recruitment). Main outcome measures: Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, BMI and subjective wellbeing. Results: There was evidence of a causal effect of BMI on subjective wellbeing such that each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI caused a 0.045 (95%CI 0.006 to 0.084, p=0.023) SD reduction in subjective wellbeing. Replication analyses provided strong evidence of an effect of BMI on satisfaction with health (Beta=0.034 (95% CI: -0.042 to -0.026) unit decrease in health satisfaction per SD increase in BMI, p<2-16). There was no clear evidence of a causal effect between subjective wellbeing and the other physical health measures in either direction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a higher BMI lowers subjective wellbeing. Our replication analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting the effect in middle-age is driven by satisfaction with health. BMI is a modifiable determinant and therefore, our study provides further motivation to tackle the obesity epidemic because of the knock-on effects of higher BMI on subjective wellbeing.

AB  - Background: Body mass index (BMI) is inversely associated with lung cancer in observational studies, despite obesity increases risk for many other cancers. Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis was previously employed to clarify the causal role of BMI in lung cancer. However, the results of MR were potentially biased by BMI-SNPs with pleiotropic effects on smoking and hence violating the assumption of MR. Objective: To examine the causal role of BMI in lung cancer using MR analysis after excluding BMI-SNPs with potential pleiotropic effects on smoking. Methods: The OncoArray data from the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) team of the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) were used. To obtain a valid genetic instrument for MR analysis, we first identified a set of 241 BMI-SNPs (P<10-5) from the GIANT consortium, then filtered out SNPs with potential pleiotropic effects on smoking using causal network inference, and obtained a final set of 46 SNPs to calculate the genetic risk score for BMI (GRS46). Logistic regression model tested its association with lung cancer adjusting for age, sex, and genetic principle components. We compared results of GRS46 with those from GRS241 that included pleiotropic SNPs. Results: A total of 32,240 subjects of European descent (17,976 lung cancer cases and 14,264 controls) were included in the analysis. The average age was 63.0 (SD: 10.5) years, 61.2% were male, 59.5% were overweight (BMI: 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) or obese (BMI>=30 kg/m2), and 79.3% were ever smokers. GRS46 was positively associated with lung cancer (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.20-2.07) in both never smokers (OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.10-4.31) and ever smokers (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02-1.92). GRS46 was significantly associated with increased risk of non-small cell lung cancer (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.21-2.36), adenocarcinoma (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.19-2.60), and squamous cell carcinoma (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.18-3.33), but not with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.63-2.64). In contrast, GRS241 was significantly associated with SCLC (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.21-2.05), which is highly attributable to smoking, but not associated with lung cancer subgroups that are not or less attributable to smoking: never smokers (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.78-1.29) and adenocarcinoma (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.92-1.24). The pleiotropic smoking-associated SNPs in GRS241 might have confounded the results in these subgroups. Conclusion: Increased BMI is a risk factor for lung cancer in both never and ever smokers and for major histological subtypes after accounting for genetic pleiotropism. We demonstrated that previous MR analyses that used a BMI-GRS including SNPs with pleiotropic effects on smoking could yield spurious results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased adiposity is linked with higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases. We aimed to determine to what extent elevated body mass index (BMI) within the normal weight range has causal effects on the detailed systemic metabolite profile in early adulthood., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used Mendelian randomization to estimate causal effects of BMI on 82 metabolic measures in 12,664 adolescents and young adults from four population-based cohorts in Finland (mean age 26 y, range 16-39 y; 51% women; mean +/- standard deviation BMI 24 +/- 4 kg/m(2)). Circulating metabolites were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays. In cross-sectional analyses, elevated BMI was adversely associated with cardiometabolic risk markers throughout the systemic metabolite profile, including lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acid composition, amino acids, inflammatory markers, and various hormones (p<0.0005 for 68 measures). Metabolite associations with BMI were generally stronger for men than for women (median 136%, interquartile range 125%-183%). A gene score for predisposition to elevated BMI, composed of 32 established genetic correlates, was used as the instrument to assess causality. Causal effects of elevated BMI closely matched observational estimates (correspondence 87% +/- 3%; R(2)= 0.89), suggesting causative influences of adiposity on the levels of numerous metabolites (p<0.0005 for 24 measures), including lipoprotein lipid subclasses and particle size, branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, and inflammation-related glycoprotein acetyls. Causal analyses of certain metabolites and potential sex differences warrant stronger statistical power. Metabolite changes associated with change in BMI during 6 y of follow-up were examined for 1,488 individuals. Change in BMI was accompanied by widespread metabolite changes, which had an association pattern similar to that of the cross-sectional observations, yet with greater metabolic effects (correspondence 160% +/- 2%; R(2) = 0.92)., CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization indicates causal adverse effects of increased adiposity with multiple cardiometabolic risk markers across the metabolite profile in adolescents and young adults within the non-obese weight range. Consistent with the causal influences of adiposity, weight changes were paralleled by extensive metabolic changes, suggesting a broadly modifiable systemic metabolite profile in early adulthood.

AB  - Background: The extent to which effects of BMI on coronary heart disease (CHD) are mediated by gylcaemic and lipid risk factors is unclear. Methods: We used two-sample Mendelian randomization to determine the causal effect of: (i) BMI on CHD (60,801 cases; 123, 504 controls), type 2 diabetes (T2DM; 34,840 cases; 114,981 controls), fasting glucose (n=46,186), insulin (n=38,238), HbA1c (n=46,368), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (n=188,577); (ii) glycaemic and lipids traits on CHD; and (iii) extent to which these traits mediated any effect of BMI on CHD. Findings: One standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI (~ 4.5kg/m2) increased CHD (odds ratio=1.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27, 1.66)) and T2DM (1.96 (1.35, 2.83)), and levels of fasting glucose (0.07mmol/l (95%CI 0.03, 0.11)), HbA1c (0.05% (95%CI 0.01, 0.08)), fasting insulin (0.18log pmol/l (95%CI 0.14, 0.22)) and triglycerides (0.20 SD (95%CI 0.14, 0.26)), and lowered levels of HDL-C (-0.23 SD (95%CI -0.32, -0.15)). BMI was not causally related to LDL-C. After accounting for potential pleiotropy, triglycerides, HbA1c and T2DM were causally related to CHD. The BMI-CHD effect reduced from 1.45 to 1.16 (95%CI 0.99, 1.36) and to 1.36 (95%CI 1.19, 1.57) with genetic adjustment for triglycerides or HbA1c respectively, and to 1.09 (95%CI 0.94, 1.27) with adjustment for both. Interpretation: Increased triglyceride levels and poor glycaemic control appear to mediate much of the effect of BMI on CHD.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The extent to which effects of BMI on CHD are mediated by glycaemic and lipid risk factors is unclear. In this study we examined the effects of these traits using genetic evidence., METHODS: We used two-sample Mendelian randomisation to determine: (1) the causal effect of BMI on CHD (60,801 case vs 123,504 control participants), type 2 diabetes (34,840 case vs 114,981 control participants), fasting glucose (n = 46,186), insulin (n = 38,238), HbA1c (n = 46,368) and LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols (n = 188,577); (2) the causal effects of glycaemic and lipids traits on CHD; and (3) the extent to which these traits mediate any effect of BMI on CHD., RESULTS: One SD higher BMI (~ 4.5 kg/m2) was associated with higher risk of CHD (OR 1.45 [95% CI 1.27, 1.66]) and type 2 diabetes (1.96 [95% CI 1.35, 2.83]), higher levels of fasting glucose (0.07 mmol/l [95% CI 0.03, 0.11]), HbA1c (0.05% [95% CI 0.01, 0.08]), fasting insulin (0.18 log pmol/l [95% CI 0.14, 0.22]) and triacylglycerols (0.20 SD [95% CI 0.14, 0.26]) and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol (-0.23 SD [95% CI -0.32, -0.15]). There was no evidence for a causal relation between BMI and LDL-cholesterol. The causal associations of higher triacylglycerols, HbA1c and diabetes risk with CHD risk remained after performing sensitivity analyses that considered different models of horizontal pleiotropy. The BMI-CHD effect reduced from 1.45 to 1.16 (95% CI 0.99, 1.36) and to 1.36 (95% CI 1.19, 1.57) with genetic adjustment for triacylglycerols or HbA1c, respectively, and to 1.09 (95% CI 0.94, 1.27) with adjustment for both., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased triacylglycerol levels and poor glycaemic control appear to mediate much of the effect of BMI on CHD.

AB  - Background: Previously reported observational associations between risk factors and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) could reflect residual confounding, reverse causation, or measurement error. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as proxies for modifiable risk factors to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Methods: We used MR to evaluate the causal role of 13 previously reported risk factors in overall and histotype-specific EOC in up to 25,509 case subjects and 40,941 controls in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. Inverse-variance weighted models were employed to generate effect estimates and MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode were performed to examine evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. A Bonferroni-corrected P-value threshold was used to establish "strong evidence" (P<0.0038) and "suggestive evidence" (0.0038<P<0.05) for associations. Results: There was strong or suggestive evidence that 9 of 13 risk factors were causally associated with overall or histotype-specific EOC. Genetic liability to endometriosis was strongly associated with EOC (OR per log odds higher liability:1.27,95%CI:1.16-1.40;P=6.94x10-7) and lifetime smoking exposure was suggestively associated with EOC (OR per unit increase in smoking score:1.36,95%CI:1.04-1.78;P=0.02). In histotype-stratified analyses, the strongest associations found were between: height and clear cell carcinoma (OR per SD increase:1.36,95%CI:1.15-1.61;P=0.0003); age at natural menopause and endometrioid carcinoma (OR per year later onset:1.09,95% CI:1.02-1.16;P=0.007); and genetic liability to polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrioid carcinoma (OR per log odds higher liability:0.74,95% CI:0.62-0.90;P=0.002). There was little evidence that genetic liability to type 2 diabetes, parity, or circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and sex hormone-binding globulin were associated with ovarian cancer or its subtypes. Conclusions: Our comprehensive examination of possible etiological drivers of ovarian carcinogenesis supports a causal role for few of these factors in epithelial ovarian cancer and suggests distinct etiologies across histotypes.

AB  - Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of height and body mass index (BMI) in ~250000 European participants have led to the discovery of ~700 and ~100 nearly independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these traits, respectively. Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ~450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N ~700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P < 1 x 10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ~24.6% of the variance of height and ~6.0% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ~0.44 and ~0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) stand as powerful experimental designs for identifying DNA variants associated with complex traits and diseases. In the past decade, both the number of such studies and their sample sizes have increased dramatically. Recent GWAS of height and body mass index (BMI) in ~250,000 European participants have led to the discovery of ~700 and ~100 nearly independent SNPs associated with these traits, respectively. Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ~450,000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry.

The genome-wide significant SNPs explain ~24.6% of the variance of height and ~5% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were 0.44 and 0.20, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and eQTL data by Summary-data based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), we identified an enrichment of eQTLs amongst lead height and BMI signals, prioritisting 684 and 134 genes, respectively.

AB  - Background: Low birthweight (BW) has been associated with a higher risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in epidemiological studies. The Barker hypothesis posits that intrauterine growth restriction resulting in lower BW is causal for these diseases, but causality and mechanisms are difficult to infer from observational studies. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a new tool to address this important question. Methods: We performed regression analyses to assess associations of self-reported BW with CVD and T2D in 237,631 individuals from the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort study aged 40-69 years recruited across UK in 2006-2010. Further, we assessed the causal relationship of such associations using the two-sample MR approach, estimating the causal effect by contrasting the SNP effects on the exposure with the SNP effects on the outcome using independent publicly available genome-wide association datasets. Results: In the observational analyses, BW showed strong inverse associations with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (β, -0.83 and -0.26; per raw unit in outcomes and SD change in BW; 95% CI, -0.90, -0.75 and -0.31, -0.22, respectively), T2D (odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79, 0.87), lipid-lowering treatment (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81, 0.86) and CAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78, 0.94); while the associations with adult body mass index (BMI) and body fat (β, 0.04 and 0.02; per SD change in outcomes and BW; 95% CI, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.01, 0.02, respectively) were positive. The MR analyses indicated inverse causal associations of BW with low density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2-hour glucose, CAD and T2D, and positive causal association with BMI; but no associations with blood pressure. Sensitivity analyses and robust MR methods provided consistent results and indicated no horizontal pleiotropy. Conclusion: Our study indicates that lower BW is causally and directly related with increased susceptibility to CAD and T2D in adulthood. This causal relationship is not mediated by adult obesity or hypertension.

AB  - Background: Inverse association between premorbid body mass index (BMI) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been discovered in observational studies; however, whether this association is causal remains largely unknown. Methods: We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach to evaluate the causal relationship of genetically increased BMI with the risk of ALS. The analyses were implemented using summary statistics obtained for the independent instruments identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies of BMI (up to ~770,000 individuals) and ALS (up to ~81,000 individuals). The causal relationship between BMI and ALS was estimated using inverse-variance weighted methods and was further validated through extensive complementary and sensitivity analyses. Findings: Using 1,031 instruments strongly related to BMI, the causal effect of per one standard deviation increase of BMI was estimated to be 1.04 (95% CI 0.97~1.11, p=0.275) in the European population. The null association between BMI and ALS discovered in the European population also held in the East Asian population and was robust against various modeling assumptions and outlier biases. Additionally, the Egger-regression and MR-PRESSO ruled out the possibility of horizontal pleiotropic effects of instruments. Interpretation: Our results do not support the causal role of genetically increased or decreased BMI on the risk of ALS.

AB  - The association between lower birth weight and childhood asthma is well established by observational studies. However, it remains unclear whether the influence of lower birth weight on asthma can persist into adulthood. Here, we conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the causal relationship of birth weight on the risk of adult asthma. Specifically, we carefully selected genetic instruments based on summary statistics obtained from large-scale genome-wide association meta-analyses of birth weight (up to ~160,000 individuals) and adult asthma (up to ~62,000 individuals). We performed Mendelian randomization using two separate approaches: a genetic risk score approach and a two-sample inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach. With 37 genetic instruments for birth weight, we estimated the causal effect per one standard deviation (SD) change of birth weight to be an odds ratio (OR) of 1.00 (95% CI 0.98~1.03, p=0.737) using the genetic risk score method. We did not observe nonlinear relationship or gender difference for the estimated causal effect. In addition, with the IVW method, we estimated the causal effect of birth weight on adult asthma was observed (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.84~1.24, p=0.813). Additionally, the iMAP method provides no additional genome-wide evidence supporting the causal effects of birth weight on adult asthma. The result of the IVW method was robust against various sensitivity analyses, and MR-PRESSO and the Egger regression showed that no instrument outliers and no horizontal pleiotropy were likely to bias the results. Overall, this Mendelian randomization study provides no evidence for the fetal origins of diseases hypothesis for adult asthma, implying that the impact of birth weight on asthma in years of children and adolescents does not persist into adult and previous findings may be biased by confounders.

AB  - Background: It has long been hypothesized that birth weight has a profound long-term impact on individual predisposition to various diseases at adulthood: a hypothesis commonly referred to as the fetal origins of adult diseases. However, it is not fully clear to what extent the fetal origins of adult diseases hypothesis holds and it is also not completely known what types of adult diseases are causally affected by birth weight. Determining the causal impact of birth weight on various adult diseases through traditional randomised intervention studies is a challenging task. Methods: Mendelian randomisation was employed and multiple genetic variants associated with birth weight were used as instruments to explore the relationship between 21 adult diseases and 38 other complex traits from 37 large-scale genome-wide association studies up to 340,000 individuals of European ancestry. Causal effects of birth weight were estimated using inverse-variance weighted methods. The identified causal relationships between birth weight and adult diseases were further validated through extensive sensitivity analyses and simulations. Results: Among the 21 adult diseases, three were identified to be inversely causally affected by birth weight with a statistical significance level passing the Bonferroni corrected significance threshold. The measurement unit of birth weight was defined as its standard deviation (i.e. 488 grams), and one unit lower birth weight was causally related to an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and BMI-adjusted T2D, with the estimated odds ratios of 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 - 1.53, p = 1.54E-5], 1.30 (95% CI 1.13 - 1.51, p = 3.31E-4), 1.41 (95% CI 1.15 - 1.73, p = 1.11E-3) and 1.54 (95% CI 1.25 - 1.89, p = 6.07E-5), respectively. All these identified causal associations were robust across various sensitivity analyses that guard against various confounding due to pleiotropy or maternal effects as well as inverse causation. In addition, analysis on 38 additional complex traits found that the inverse causal association between birth weight and CAD/MI/T2D was not likely to be mediated by other risk factors such as blood-pressure related traits and adult weight. Conclusions: The results suggest that lower birth weight is causally associated with an increased risk of CAD, MI and T2D in later life, supporting the fetal origins of adult diseases hypothesis.

AB  - Osteoarthritis is a common complex disease imposing a large public-health burden. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study for osteoarthritis, using data across 16.5 million variants from the UK Biobank resource. After performing replication and meta-analysis in up to 30,727 cases and 297,191 controls, we identified nine new osteoarthritis loci, in all of which the most likely causal variant was noncoding. For three loci, we detected association with biologically relevant radiographic endophenotypes, and in five signals we identified genes that were differentially expressed in degraded compared with intact articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis. We established causal effects on osteoarthritis for higher body mass index but not for triglyceride levels or genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Obesity-related traits have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in observational studies, but these associations may be biased by confounding factors and reverse causation. In this study, we specifically conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to overcome these limitations and test the associations of obesity-related traits (other than body mass index (BMI)) (n = 322,154) with CAD (22,233 cases and 64,762 controls) by using summary-level data from previous studies. The methods utilized to estimate these associations included the inverse-variance weighted method, the weighted median method and MR-Egger regression. Our results supported causal effects of BMI, hip circumference (HC), waist circumference (WC), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) on CAD. The associations of BMI-adjusted HC and WC with CAD were reversed, unlike that of WHR. In MR analyses excluding overlapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from obesity-related traits, the associations of these traits with CAD were preserved. The associations of BMI-adjusted HC and WC with CAD require further investigation, as collider stratification may be occurring. Additionally, central adiposity (measured by WHR) separated from general adiposity (measured by BMI) and general adiposity might pose similar risks for CAD. In clinical practice, physicians should pay attention to the potential effects of different obesity-related traits on CAD.

AB  - Health risk factors such as body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol and blood pressure are associated with many common diseases. It often remains unclear whether the risk factors are cause or consequence of disease, or whether the associations are the result of confounding. Genetic methods are useful to infer causality because genetic variants are present from birth and therefore unlikely to be confounded with environmental factors. We develop and apply a method (GSMR) that performs a multi-SNP Mendelian Randomization analysis using summary-level data from large genome-wide association studies (sample sizes of up to 405,072) to test the causal associations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum cholesterols, blood pressures, height and years of schooling (EduYears) with a range of common diseases. We identify a number of causal associations including a protective effect of LDL-cholesterol against type-2 diabetes (T2D) that might explain the side effects of statins on T2D, a protective effect of EduYears against Alzheimer's disease, and bidirectional associations with opposite effects (e.g. higher BMI increases the risk of T2D but the effect T2D of BMI is negative). HDL-cholesterol has a significant risk effect on age-related macular degeneration, and the effect size remains significant accounting for the other risk factors. Our study develops powerful tools to integrate summary data from large studies to infer causality, and provides important candidates to be prioritized for further studies in medical research and for drug discovery.
